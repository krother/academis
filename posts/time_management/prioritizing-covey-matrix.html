<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most probably, you have more to do than you would like to. This is normal for most people. But not everybody lives comfortably with that. The <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Covey Matrix</span> is a tool that helps you prioritize your work and brings you back into charge.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/uploaded/CoveyMatrixIcons_1.png\" align=\"none\" width=\"500\"><h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How it works:<br></h4><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Draw a table with four quadrants, and sort each of your tasks into one. The four quadrants are:</p><ol style=\"text-align: justify;\"><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Necessity (urgent and important):</span> Emergencies, deadlines, well-prepared meetings. These need to be done first.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Quality (important): </span>Planning, implementation, and your own development. Maximize the time spent in this area, because it generates value in the long run.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Deception (urgent):</span> emails, paperwork, badly prepared meetings. Try to get rid of as much as possible.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Waste (not urgent and not important):</span> Browsing. Reading random posts on Facebook. Junk mails. Waste is toxic. Don't touch it! If you need a break, find yourself a distraction that has nothing to do with computers.</li></ol><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"></div><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Assigning tasks to the four quadrants is a good way to quickly make a plan for the day - especially the first day after vacations. It also works for 'Mail Box'-type exercises found in job assessments (you get a heap of taks and have to prioritize or allocate resources, and of course you have too little of everything).<br></p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"></div><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Covey Matrix is a true classic from time management. Used consequently, it can make your work day a lot more pleasant.</p>
