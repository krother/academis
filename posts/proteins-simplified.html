<p>This is a series of pictures I use to explain proteins from scratch. I got rid of all chemical details, reduced the amino acids to just four types and don't even mention essential things like cysteine bonds. Yet, the model allows students to draw their own conclusions on questions like:</p><ul><li>How many possible proteins exist?</li><li>How would the composition of a secretory protein differ from a membrane protein?</li><li>The phosphate groups of DNA are negatively charged. How would a protein that binds DNA probably look like?</li></ul><p>The pictures are in German. If you want to edit the language, the according SVG files are available <a href=\"mailto:krother@academis.eu\">on request</a>.</p><hr><img class=\"well\" src=\"/static/biochemistry/aminosaeure.png\" alt=\"amino acid\" width=\"500\"><hr><img class=\"well\" src=\"/static/biochemistry/aminosaeure_arten.png\" alt=\"amino acid types\" width=\"500\"><hr><img class=\"well\"  src=\"/static/biochemistry/peptidbindung.png\" alt=\"peptide bond\" width=\"500\"><hr><img class=\"well\" src=\"/static/biochemistry/kombinationen.png\" alt=\"combinations of amino acids\" width=\"500\"><hr><img class=\"well\" src=\"/static/biochemistry/proteinfaltung.png\" alt=\"protein folding\" width=\"500\"><hr><a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.
