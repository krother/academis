# Python Best Practices

Experienced programmers know that good programming involves a lot more than
writing code. Python offers an established set of techniques from several areas.
Python offers many advanced language features that promote writing less verbose, easily readable, *"pythonic"* code. Automated tests ensure that bugs donâ€™t
come back. Finally, maintenance practices keep programming project in a healthy state as a program grows.

This training provides a hands-on overview of accepted
best practices for structuring, testing and maintenaining Python code.
