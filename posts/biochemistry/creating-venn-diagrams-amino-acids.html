They also should hear about the basic structure of amino acids.</p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>Explain <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram\" target=\"_blank\">Venn Diagrams</a> on the board using a concrete example (sports, food). Then ask them to create a Venn Diagram for amino acids. Make sure they have pen and paper, then share the amino acid structures. Give your group 20 minutes time for drawing.</p><h4>Evaluation</h4><p>Collect suggestions from the group to draw one big diagram on the board. Point out key properties of amino acids the students identified correctly. Add labels to the groups. Make sure all amino acids make it to the final diagram. Leave time for Q &amp; A.</p><p>As a variation, you can let your students work in small groups with larger sheets of paper, which they present at the end.<p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>I found this exercise a good alternative to a lecture on amino acid structures, as it saves the students a presentation full of chemical structures. As a side effect, constructing the Venn diagram reinforces their knowledge on functional groups. </p>
