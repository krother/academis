In the tradition of European Universities, **Rhetoric** was one of the subjects in the *trivia*, the basic education of students. *"Trivium"* literally means *"crossing"* or *"public place"*. 
Although medieval universities were only open to a minority, the word reminds us that **learning to speak in public is meant for everybody**.

This article lists **7 challenges** designed to help a group to become better public speakers. If you want to develop your team at your workplace, if you are a group of people interested in rhetoric, or if you simply want to spice up your curriculum, feel invited to the challenge.

Here are the challenges:

----

## 1. Curate your personal reading list

There are tons of excellent materials on speaking on the web. [Andre Dlugan](http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/public-speaking-blogs/) lists 100 speaking blogs alone. There is no single **"Best of** collection, because every group has specific needs. Which are your most relevant ones?

**Challenge: Create a short reading list containing your 10 favourite articles.**

----

## 2. Curate speaking videos

To learn public speaking, little is as motivating as a good example. There are thousands of decent speech videos on the web, probably many from your area of expertise as well. By watching and comparing speeches, you can learn a lot of things you like and dislike. If you are interested in speaking in general, [John Zimmers collection of speech analyses](https://mannerofspeaking.org/speech-analyses/) are a great starting point.

**Challenge: Compile your three favourite speech videos and watch them together.**

## 3. Give nascent speakers positive recognition

Many inexperienced speakers feel insecure on the stage at first. This is normal. Security comes with giving speeches over and over. To grow great speakers it is essential to make sure they give the next speech. For that they need encouraging, positive feedback. At the same time, it needs to be honest feedback. Your job as a peer or mentor is to find something good in every speech, even if most of it is really bad.

**Challenge: Find one good thing in every speech and let the speaker know they should do that again.**

----

## 4. Give experienced speakers detailed feedback

With growing experience, most speakers become more self-confident. Still, they need feedback from other people to improve. Feedback for experienced speakers still needs to be encouraging - they also deserve to be told what works well. But they also need concrete, specific suggestions what to improve and how. These suggestions are not always easy to find.

**Challenge: Tell an experienced speaker one good thing they did and one concrete suggestion.**

----

## 5. Ask a professional speaker for advice

With speaking and giving and receiving feedback, speakers improve a lot. Eventually, you will reach a point where improvement slows down. Either you run out of recommendations, or the process gets repetitive. Every professional speaker has been there before. This is the point to ask them what to do next. Although you could pay someone to act as a coach, you might start by asking for a brief hint. Finding and approaching a professional speaker is not too difficult, they have a tendency to hang out in the public. 

**Challenge: Ask a professional speaker for a useful recommendation.**

## 6. Create speaking challenges

To become better at public speaking, one must first speak. To foster the skills of a nascent speaker, guide them through a series of small speaking assignments. Such speaking assignments help the reluctant speaker to become comfortable with speaking, the enthusiastic speaker to focus, and the audience to know what to expect. Completing the assignments one by one creates a feeling of progress, of success. The biggest advantage is that you can create specific challenges for your topic. 

For instance, a series of seven speaking challenges for **programmers** could look like this:

1. **Hello World** -- Introduce yourself
2. **Explain Your Code** -- Present a short piece of code
3. **The Lightning Talk** -- Present a project of yours
4. **Code Review** -- Discuss a piece of code written by someone else
5. **The End User** -- Explain what you do to a non-programmer
6. **Q & A** -- Explain a project and answer questions from the audience.
7. **Retrospective** -- Reflect what you learned in the six previous speeches.

To run a series of speech challenges successfully, a strict time limit is essential. For the above series, I recommend a limit of 5-10 minutes for each speech. Make sure speakers receive encouraging, useful feedback afterwards (you can use this [Feedback Sheet [PDF]](files/feedback_sheet.pdf) and ask the audience to write down one good thing and one suggestion for the presenter.) 

**Challenge: Build a set of speaking assignments tailored for your peer group.**


## 7. Organize a speaking event

Completing small speaking challenges is a great way to learn. What are we learning public speaking for? At some point, a speaker will need a bigger stage. Give them that bigger stage! They are public speakers, and they deserve to know it. This is the place where you celebrate your mutual learning success!

**Challenge: Organize a speaking event for new speakers.**
