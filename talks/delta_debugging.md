# Delta Debugging

This presentation helps you to debug Python code more systematically. I am going to present an example for **Delta Debugging**Â (sometimes dubbed automatic debugging), a scientific debugging approach pioneered by **Prof. Andreas Zeller**, author of the landmark book in this field: [Why Programs Fail](http://www.wyprogramsfail.com). The example will introduce Delta Debugging itself and highlight its strengths and weaknesses. If you would like to know what other options for debugging you have apart from the Python debugger and the occasional `print` statement, this talk is for you.
