# Feedback Methods

In the table you find some of my favourite methods for collecting feedback at the end of a lesson or course.

| technique | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Questionnaire | Very formal but accurate feedback. |
Online Survey | Easy to evaluate, but less immediate than questionnaire.  |
Voting Box | Place to toss tokens in (poker chips) to vote for alternatives (topics rather than evaluation of quality) |
Fist to Five | Students show zero to five fingers to rate the quality of the lesson or their learning succes. |
Clicker Questions | clickers are electronic devices by which students can answer to questions with up to 4 alternatives (A, B, C, D). |
Socrative.com | Mobile phone app for online questions. |
| Four Corners | Participants collect answers to a different question in each corner of the room |
