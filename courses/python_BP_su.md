
# Python Best Practices

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of Python

## Target Audience

Python programmers who would like to learn best practices for structuring, testing and maintenaining Python code.

## Course Description

Experienced programmers know that good programming involves a lot more than writing code. Python offers an established set of techniques from several areas and many advanced language features that promote writing less verbose, easily readable, "pythonic" code. Automated tests ensure that bugs donâ€™t come back. Finally, maintenance practices keep programming project in a healthy state as a program grows.

This training provides a hands-on overview of the accepted best practices for structuring, testing and maintenaining Python code.
