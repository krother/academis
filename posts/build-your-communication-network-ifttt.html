<figure><img src=\"/static/uploaded/ifttt.png\" width=\"640\"></figure><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are you losing track of which web tool or social media you can use for what? Would you prefer if your favorite web media would communicate among each other a little more? This is where <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.ifttt.com\" target=\"_blank\">ifttt</a> comes in. The service allows you to interconnect a multitude of services by defining rules following the scheme <b>if this then that</b>. E.g.:</p><ul><li>Whenever you write something on Facebook, the same message appears on LinkedIn.</li><li>Your favorite messages from Twitter get collected on a web page of your choice.</li><li>When your competitor publishes a paper, you get a text message (via a RSS feed from PubMed).</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The services that <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.ifttt.com\" target=\"_blank\">ifttt</a> can plug together include text messages, weather forecast and even phonecalls. If you want, you can build a complex communication infrastructure - a single event can trigger a chain reaction. For me, <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.ifttt.com\" target=\"_blank\">ifttt</a> made it a lot easier to distribute my blog announcement to various social media - so I have more time to focus on the content.</p>
