# Coding Challenge: The Recursive Snowflake

### The Challenge

Write a program, that for a parameter `n=1` creates a basic shape out of four straight lines:

![n=1](images/snowflake1.png)

When you increase `n`, each line gets replaced by a smaller version of the basic shape. For, instance with `n=2` you get:

![n=2](images/snowflake2.png)

And with `n=5`:

![n=5](images/snowflake3.png)

When your program is able to produce a picture for `0 < n < 6`, you have mastered this challenge.

### What you can exercise in this coding challenge:

* Recursive algorithms
* The **Pillow** library in Python
* The **turtle** module in Python
