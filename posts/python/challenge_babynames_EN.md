# Programming Exercises for Data Analysis, Level A1

These exercises are for people who are learning a new programming language and would like to apply it to data analysis. They work with **Python**, **R**, but also when you getting familiar with libraries like **pandas**.

During the exercises, you will analyze a *dataset of U.S. baby names*.

## Exercise 1

Write a program that reads the file **'yob2000.txt'**, prints the contents to the screen and writes the data to a different file.

----

## Exercise 2

Write a program that reads the file **'yob2000.txt'**, calculates the sum of the third column and prints the sum to the screen.

----

## Exercise 3

Like Exercise 2, but calculate two separate sums for boys and girls.

----

## Exercise 4

Write a program that reads the file **'yob2000.txt'**, and counts how many names occur 1000 times or more frequently.

----

## Exercise 5

Write a program that reads the file **'yob2000.txt'**, and creates a list containing the percentages of a name on the total births of that year. Verify that the sum of percentages is 100%. Write the names and percentages to a file.

----

## Exercise 6

Like Exercise 5, but separate for boys and girls. 

----

## Exercise 7

Introduce an extra column that contains the first letter of the name. Count how many names start with **'A'**.

----

## Exercise 8

Introduce an extra column that contains the length of the name. Print the 10 longest names to the screen.

----

## Exercise 9

Identify and print all lines containing one particular name (e.g. your own).

----

## Exercise 10

Create a list containing the years **`1880, 1881, 1882 ... 2015`**.

----

## Exercise 11

Create a list containing the file names **'yob1880.txt', 'yob1881.txt' â€¦ 'yob2015.txt'**. 

----

## Exercise 12

Pick a name (e.g. your own). Create a table with two columns extracted from the **'names/'** dataset: year and number of babies with that name.

----

## Exercise 13

Like Exercise 12, but add a 0, if the name does not occur.

----

## Exercise 14

Plot the number of babies over year (for one name).

----

## Exercise 15

Plot the number of babies over year (for two names).

----

## Exercise 16

Create a bar plot showing 5 selected names for the year 2015.

----

## Exercise 17

Create a bar plot showing 5 selected names in three bar groups for the years 1900, 1950 and 2000.

----

## Exercise 18

Create a plot that shows the total birth rate in the U.S. over time.
