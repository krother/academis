making science and complex ideas understandable and memorable for ordinary folks

# TOPIC 1: Building a technical talk from a premise

Main points:

* design a premise for the entire talk first
* design a premise for each slide
* throw the rest away
* three-point strategy: Select, Simplify, Eliminate


# TOPIC 2: The onion structure

Discuss the explanation of a scientific topic from the beginning to the end. Uses an incremental structure that presents an idea, repeats the idea and adds a detail, and so on until a sufficient level of depth is reached.

Example: human and banana are 50% similar.


# TOPIC 3: building drama into a scientific talk

Main points:

* the 'hero story' structure is applicable to scientific subjects
* how to build suspense by sorting questions/hypotheses and observations
* how can you make data, formulas, diagrams more interesting without losing credibility


# TOPIC 4: Things technical presenters need most

Many things taught by presentation coaches miss the point if you prepare a technical talk. This includes advice like:

* fake it until you make it
* use a maximum of 4 words per slide
* body language is the majority of your communication

when you talk about speaking to engineers, programmers and scientists, the above statements may ruin your credibility. 

On the other hand, hand things many technical speakers find helpful are:

* how to combat nervousness
* how to start a talk
* how to establish eye contact
* how to handle Q & A well


## prepare to talk about a technical topic

methods:

* connect the dots - lay out your plots / diagrams etc out in front of you and try to see the story that connects them. Leave out stuff.
* build drama and suspense
* one premise per slide
* one formula per slide
* one diagram per slide
* 7+-2 is the limit for information
* stick to one main example throughout the presentation
* start with a problem
* onion structure
* intro methods results discussion is not a structure - but it maps to a "hero story"
* 

# Chap 13:
To change a written scientific paper into an oral presentation, the presenter must follow three “s words”: Select, Synthesize, and Simplify.

resist the temptation to overload the presentation with
information.

It is generally unwise to introduce more than one new
idea every 2 to 3 minutes.

# Potworowski

Select, Simplify, Eliminate (non-pertinent material, repetitive examples, tangents)

post-interpretation:OBSERVATION -> CONCLUSION (boring)
mild-pre:QUESTION -> OBSERVATION
pre:QUESTION->HYPOTHESIS IS IT A OR B-> OBSERVATION



# Uri Alon

For example, a premise can be this:Cells
change their shape by regulating their cytoskeleton.
The following is not a premise:
Cell shape and the cytoskeleton. Why? It
is not a full sentence. The premise is your
compass for what to include. 

build a Premise for each slide.




Structure
Basic structure:
Opening – body - closing

### Military briefing:
Say what you will say, say it, say what you said. 
(safe but boring) 

### Three points:
Opening – three points – closing
(solid)

### Ten points:
Opening – ten points – closing
(very boring)

### Timeline:
Opening - past – present – future - closing

### Simple persuasion:
Con – pro
(good for improvised speech about pro)

### Build an enemy: 
Opening, con-pro, con-pro, con-pro, closing 
(solid to persuade of pro, sometimes a little boring) 

### Building a climax:
Opening – A – B – C – closing
(select strongest point for C)


### Hero story:
(very strong storytelling structure for everything)
Introduce hero+villain (or problem)
Peripety (hero struggles)
Climax
Way home

### AIDA:
(standard persuasive structure)
Attention
Interest
Desire
Action

### Onion
(good for complex technical subjects)

Opening
1st iteration
Python is a programming language
2nd iteration
Python is a object-oriented programming language
3rd iteration
Python is a dynamically typed object-oriented programming language
Closing
