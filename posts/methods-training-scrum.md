# Methods for training Scrum

**Scrum** is currently the most common framework to manage Agile software projects. Many Agile practices are applicable to research, even to manage a household. Thus, there are many reasons to learn a bit about Scrum. To learn how Scrum works, it is best to experience it yourself.

When preparing an interactive training session on Scrum, the following exercises and resources may save you a lot of preparation time.

* [**Ball Point Game by Boris Gloger**](http://borisgloger.com/2008/03/15/the-scrum-ball-point-game) - an icebreaker exercise where you can feel improvement over five iterations.
* [**Build your own Scrum by Adam Weisbart**](http://weisbart.com/byos) - a dynamic group exercise where Scrum learners visualize the Scrum process.
* [**Scrum Lego City by Agile42**](http://www.agile42.com/en/training/scrum-lego-city/) - build a city out of Lego bricks from a backlog in your Scrum Team.
* [**Seapine Agile Expedition**](http://www.seapine.com/exploreagile) - a lightweight explanation of Agile methods and best practices. Great for looking things up.

If you already know Scrum and would like to see an Agile process in action after work, I recommend playing the board game [**Space Alert**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Alert). In this cooperative game key elements of Scrum come in handy (at least your characters will die very soon without proper retrospetives).
