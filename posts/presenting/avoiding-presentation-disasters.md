# Avoiding Presentation Disasters

When giving a talk at a conference, many things can go right: Your topic fits the expectations of the audience, your examples rock, or you simply have a compelling story to tell.

But what if... something *does* go wrong?

### The bad news
The bad news is that there are a lot of things that can spoil a presentation -from a sudden projector failure to running out of time unexpectedly. No matter who could be blamed, you, as a speaker have to deal with the consequences - or prevent them. 

### The good news

The good news is that the master speakers of this world have plenty of advice what you can do to make better speeches. Here are my favourite sources:

#### John Zimmers Checklist
European Public Speaking Champion John Zimmer uses a [Checklist](https://mannerofspeaking.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/a-public-speakers-checklist-version-3.pdf) with about 50 points to prepare minutiously for speaking engagements. The list covers everything from spare batteries to handkerchiefs.

#### Scott Berkuns Checklist
For the speech preparation itself, professional Speaker Scott Berkun has a <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2011/speakers-checklist">Checklist</a> with hints for before, during, and after your talk that help to avoid the biggest pitfalls.

### Long-term improvement
In the long run, personal feedback on your presentations is crucial for improving. Approaching colleagues for their opinion, trial presentations, or joining a local speaking club will bring you closer to a standing ovation than hours spent optimizing your slides.
