<h1 id="feedback-methods">Feedback Methods</h1>
<p>In the table you find some of my favourite methods for collecting feedback at the end of a lesson or course.</p>
<p>| technique | description | |-----------|-------------| | Questionnaire | Very formal but accurate feedback. | Online survey | Easy to evaluate, but less immediate than questionnaire. | Voting box | Place to toss tokens in (poker chips) to vote for alternatives | (topics rather than evaluation of quality) | Fist to five | Students show zero to five fingers to rate the quality of the lesson or their learning succes. | Clicker questions | clickers are electronic devices by which students can answer to questions with up to 4 alternatives (A, B, C, D). | Socrative.com | Mobile phone app for online questions. |</p>
