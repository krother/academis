<h1>Handling a Difficult Audience</h1>

<p><strong>by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kovacjaroslav/" target="_blank">Jaroslav Kováč</a></strong></p><p>There is plenty of advice how to attract an audience as a speaker, but usually it is assumed that the crowd in your room is either friendly or, in the worst case, indifferent.</p><p>But what would you do when things go crazy? How would you counter an audience that hates you? Or one that is convinced you have no authority on the subject? Just thinking on this matter makes many speakers sweat – and rightfully. But what can we do to prevent losing control if such a situation occurs? Exactly that was the subject of my latest workshop at the <em>Pan-European Public Speaking Conference in Krakow, Poland (Toastmasters, Spring 2014)</em>.</p><p>We can describe the engagement of the audience in two different dimensions:</p><ul class="simple"><li>if they are engaged <strong>emotionally</strong> with you and/or your speech</li><li>or if they are engaged <strong>rationally</strong>.</li></ul><p>We can treat these two dimensions as axes in a graph. Then, we can divide the graph into four different types of audience that you might encounter:</p><div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/difficult_audiences.png"></div><p>During the workshop, we have simulated four practical scenarios. The audience came up with many useful tactics how to handle the audience even in extreme situations. For the summary we picked one important rule per situation that might be your life saver – and I will share them with you now as well.</p><h3>The hostile audience</h3><p>If the audience is <strong>hostile</strong>, they are most likely engaged on their emotional side and don’t use much reasoning to argue with you. They either hate you or the subject you came up with. This can happen on various occasions – if you are announcing cost cuts in your company; if you are a politician having a speech in front of the voters of the other party; if you touch religious topics in front of a sensitive crowd. They most likely won’t listen to your arguments; they don’t see why they would need to.</p><p>If you want to overcome this situation, you need to <strong>find common ground</strong> with the audience.  Ask yourself: <strong>“What do we have in common?”</strong> and build on it. If no answer comes to your mind, you can risk and try asking the audience the same question – perhaps they will surprise you. In the end you want to get to the point where both you and audience understand that there are things that unite you (we want this company to keep running and keep employing people; we want this country to live without debt and with everyone having basic needs covered; etc) – and that the details that divide you are acknowledged and respected by both sides. You can’t change them, but you can accept them. There is not a big chance you can win them over, but you can still leave with their respect – and you should aim for it.</p><h3>The critical audience</h3><p>The <strong>critical</strong> audience usually doesn’t have any negative emotions against you; they just disagree rationally with what you have to tell. Most likely, they don’t think you are in a position to educate them and they will challenge anything you have to tell. In a more moderate case, you will just face some  counter-arguments. In the worse scenario they will refuse to listen as they think you are telling them nonsense. We have experienced such a situation in my speaking club in Brno, when a young student was trying to teach managers on how to be a good manager – the result was like a public execution.</p><p>The only way out of such a situation is to switch from the role of the preacher to the role of the <strong>facilitator</strong> – tell them that they have superior knowledge on the topic and that you are there to help them put it together. This way, you might not only save your face but even help some members in the audience to a valuable insight.</p><h3>The neutral audience</h3><p>If your audience is <strong>neutral</strong>, it is disengaged. They might have ended up in your presentation by coincidence and they don’t really care what you have to say. Your strategy should be to show them, why they should listen. You need to get them to either end of the graph – either engage them emotionally, rationally, or both.</p><p>Unless the group is entertained (emotion) or convinced the topic is relevant (ratio), they won’t pay much attention. And you need to change that. Use all the tools to <strong>involve them</strong> – ask them questions, make them move, let them work on small assignments, show them how they can benefit from listening to your speech. This might get them hooked and willing to participate in your speech.</p><h3>The friendly audience</h3><p>The last group is engaged both emotionally and rationally. But instead a negative attitude let's think about a <strong>friendly</strong> audience – the people who adore you, follow you – or simply love the topic you are planning to talk about. This type of audience can be extremely difficult to handle. When they laugh and clap after every second line, it will eat up your time. If they are so much into the topic that they ask too many questions on small details, it will disrupt your speech structure.</p><p>You need to <strong>establish clear rules</strong> with the audience. You can introduce rules either when you start or before the speech by an email/paper announcement. For example <em>“don’t clap until the speech is over”</em>, <em>“there will be a Q&amp;A after I finish speaking”</em>, etc. This way you can channel all the disturbing actions to the end of your speech and make sure that your message could get across.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>We have covered four types of difficult audiences you might encounter, and four strategies to work with them. These four strategies are:</p><ul class="simple"><li>find common ground</li><li>facilitate discussion</li><li>involve the audience</li><li>set clear rules</li></ul><p>These strategies are not only useful for the specific situations above, but they apply <strong>to any audience</strong>.</p><div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/audience_strategies.png"></div><p>If we set clear rules, talk about a common goal, involve the audience and skillfully facilitate the discussion, we should be able to handle <strong>any</strong> audience, no matter what their current emotional or rational involvement is. If we learn to internalize these strategies, we should be able to <strong>stand firm through any storm the audience can throw at you</strong>.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Don’t let them steal your thunder! Go ahead and try. ;-)</p><hr><p><i>This article is published under the conditions of a Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 (CC-BY)</i></p>
