<h1>The Fake Funding Agency</h1>

<i><b>by Kristian Rother and Pedro Fernandes</b></i><br><img alt="" src="images/fake_funding.png"><br><div style="text-align: justify;">Every grown-up scientist knows that scientific activity is more thanreading literature, doing experiments and writing papers. Planningresearch projects and preparing applications for funding are twoimportant things that keep researchers busy. There is no time too earlyto start doing these properly, as the need arises early in aresearcher's activity.<br><b>Pedro Fernandes </b>from Portugal, took a bold approach to teach thesekey skills to a group of MSc students in bioinformatics at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/">InstitutoGulbenkian de Ciência</a>. He set up a&nbsp;<b>fake funding agency</b>to which students were to prepare and submit project proposals.Although no real money was involved, students at the end of the firstyear of the MSc were keen to participate in <b>real</b> research proposals, instead of repeating old recipes from their books.<br>The fake funding agency idea consisted of five parts:<br><ul><li>A simple website with a front page, a call description, submission guidelines, a submission form, and contact information.</li><li>A strict deadline to which proposals had to be submitted.&nbsp;</li><li>An international review panel consisting of six mature scientists.&nbsp;</li><li>Short project presentations by the students.&nbsp;</li><li>A thorough discussion in&nbsp; front of an audience.<br></li></ul>Typical difficulties were also mimicked: the strict deadline forsubmission, the complicated guidelines, the need for thinkingout-of-the-box, the need to supply social and scientific impactstatements, etc. All students were able to design proper research proposals, andsubmit them in time. Some of them developed the initial effort of theproject proposal to the fake funding agency" into their MSc theses.As an example, the MSc project <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" title="" href="http://imm.fm.ul.pt/rheugulationdb/">RheugulationDB</a> developed by <b>José Teles</b> is visible online.<br>We believe that the idea of the fake funding agency can be repeated with other groups of students elsewhere. The participants will probably find the experimenthelpful when they apply for their first real grant.<br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://imm.fm.ul.pt/rheugulationdb/"></a></div>
