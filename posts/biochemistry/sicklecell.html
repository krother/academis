<h1 id="project-diagnosing-sickle-cell-anemia">Project: Diagnosing Sickle Cell Anemia</h1>
<p><strong>Programming tasks with Biopython</strong></p>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Your goal is to develop an experimental test that reveals whether a patient suffers from the hereditary disease sickle cell anemia. The test for diagnosis should use a restriction enzyme on a patients’ DNA sample. For the test to work, you need to know exactly what genetic difference to test against. In this tutorial, you will use Biopython to find out. The idea is to compare DNA and protein sequences of sickle cell and healthy globin, and to try out different restriction enzymes on them.</p>
<p>This tutorial consists of four parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the module Bio.Entrez to retrieve DNA and protein sequences from NCBI databases.</li>
<li>Use the module Bio.SeqIO to read, write, and filter information in sequence files.</li>
<li>Use the modules Bio.Seq and Bio.SeqRecord to extract exons, transcribe and translate them to protein sequences.</li>
<li>Use the module re to identify restriction sites.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>

<p>Print the id, name, and description of all human beta-globins.</p>
<h3 id="filtering-sequence-entries">2.5 Filtering sequence entries</h3>
<p>Print the same information as in task 2.4, but do not show non-globin entries : if the description contains either ‘vector’ or ‘isolate’, don’t print anything.</p>
<h3 id="optional-tasks-for-fast-programmers-1">Optional tasks for fast programmers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>2.6 Filter the list of sequence entries even further using your own criteria and save the filtered list to a FASTA file.</li>
