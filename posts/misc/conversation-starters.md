# Conversation Starters

Many people find talking to strangers at a conference or another networking event challenging. Especially if you are conversing in a foreign language, finding the first words may be difficult. You can try to kick off a conversation with a question. 

Some examples:

* How did you come to be a scientist?
* What is your laboratory really good at?
* What does successful research mean to you?
* What are the most important qualities you look for in a scientist?
* What skill or talent would you like to have in your group?
* What was your most disastrous experiment?
* What would you recommend to someone having a bad day in the lab?
* What event or activity are you looking forward to in the next few months?
* Do you have a scientific role model that inspires you?
* Is there a piece of advice you would like to share with young scientists?

You can bring a few questions on cue cards to the event. Having a few good questions up your sleeve may help you to break the ice and make acquaintances more quickly.
