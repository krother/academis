<p>In this article I would like to share literature I found on creating conference posters. All references agree that a poster is a networking tool. You can see it as an invitation to a conversation – or as a A0-sized business card. Posters are the most visual form of scientific communication. Therefore, typesetting and layout are more important than in other communication modes. Keep in mind what the musician Keith Richards said: <i>“good artists leave empty canvas”</i>.</p><dl><dt>Ten Simple Rules for a Good Poster Presentation</dt><dd>Describes what a conference poster is good for and gives hints for preparation.<br><a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030102" target="_blank">Ten simple rules for a good poster presentation.Erren TC, Bourne PE.PLoS Comput Biol. 2007 May;3(5):e102.</a></dd></dl><dl><dt>Interacting During Conferences Sessions</dt><dd>Online tutorial that emphasizes the poster as a tool to interact with other scientists.
