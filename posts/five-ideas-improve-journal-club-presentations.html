<div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/static/uploaded/five_ideas.png\" class=\"media-object\"></div><p>I hear very frequently that journal club presentations are perceived as difficult, boring or simply not as good as they could be. I have no ideal recipe to offer, but five things you could try:</p><ol><li><p><b>Five words</b><br>Ask the presenter to summarize the presentation in five words.</p></li><li><p><b>Record</b><br>Switch on a camera, phone or tablet. Share recordings with the presenter only.</p></li><li><p><b>Checklist</b><br>Provide presenters with a <a href=\"/static/uploaded/presentation_checklist.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">checklist</a> well in advance.</p></li><li><p><b>Feedback</b><br>Share <a href=\"/static/uploaded/feedback_sheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">paper slips</a> on which spectators note one positive remark and one suggestion.</p></li><li><p><b>Strict time control</b><br>Assign a volunteer to measure time and raise a signal 5' and 2' before the end.</p></li></ol><p>The ideas above can be implemented without a lot of extra effort. There are probably many more things you can try. Keep changing until you find what works for you.</p>
