<p>GANTT charts are diagrams that show the start and end dates for the phases of a project. In grant applications, they are a concise way to show Milestones and Deliverables.</p><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/static/uploaded/gantt.png\" class=\"media-object\"></div><h3>What does the diagram contain?</h3><p>Each horizontal bar represents a <b>Work Package</b> with a label on the left side. The orange wedges indicate <b>Milestones</b>, dates on which major portions of the project are expected to be finished. The yellow wedges are <b>Deliverables</b>, stepping-stones on the way. If a work package depends on another item to be completed, this is indicated by black vertical arrows.</p><h3>How to create them?</h3><p>You can make GANTT charts in MS Excel. There are decent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oD50HSBBBI\" target=\"_blank\">tutorials on YouTube</a>. For more elaborate elements like the wedges indicating Milestones and Deliverables you can either post-process the graph in Photoshop or create the entire graph in a vector graphics program like <a href=\"http://www.inkscape.org\" target=\"_blank\">Inkscape</a>. This is what I used for the graph above.</p>
