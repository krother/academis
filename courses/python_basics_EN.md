# Python Basics

**Learn to write simple programs in the Python programming language and execute them.**

## Target Audience

People with little or no previous knowledge of programming who would like to use Python to automate repetitive tasks and work together with experienced developers more smoothly.

## Description

Everybody can program! The aim of this course is to introduce people with little or no previous experience in programming to the Python language. By solving many bite-size programming tasks, you will become familiar with new commands one after the other.

In the end, you will achieve basic literacy in a programming language that you can apply yourself comfortably, or take the next learning steps on your own.
This course does not spend much time on theory but is meant to keep you writing code most of the time.
