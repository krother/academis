# Writing a Project Outline

When you start a new project, agreement with your collaborators is easy to reach. Over time it may happen, though, that people in the team remember different things and the project starts drifting apart. To keep agreement with my supervisor and with students over time I found a written outline of the project terribly useful.

In contrast to a grant application you don't need to describe everything in full detail. A 1-2 page document is sufficient. It could cover the following:

* Name of the project
* The main goal in a single sentence
* Participants with email/phone number
* Brief prose description
* Important dates and deadlines
* Milestones and/or a list of tasks
* Conditions that have to be met
* Potential risks

Here you find a [template for a project outline [DOC]](files/ProjectOutline_Template.doc). 

You might also want take a look at an [example project outline [PDF]](files/ProjectPlan_Example_REPAIRtoire.pdf). 

The main purpose of a written project outline is that all people involved have a common base of communication. This is useful in projects longer than a few weeks. When you review progress after some time it helps you to start the discussion at the same place where you left it.
