<div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object pull-left\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/uploaded/software_qa.png\" width=\"330\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Withheaps of data to evaluate, scientific software has becomeincreasingly relevant to create or evaluate results. Lots of softwareexists, but is it good enough for what you want to do? How can youtell whether you can trust a program to solve your problem? </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"background: transparent\">Inthe first place, you could treat an existing publication as a sign ofquality. Unfortunately it is not a particularly reliable one. Apublication does not tell you whether the authors are stilldeveloping their program further, whether they have stoppedmaintaining it, or whether the developers have switched fieldsaltogether. </span></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">In thispost, I would like to discuss five criteria by which you can recognizegood software.</font></p></div><h4>1) What has the software been used for?</h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"background: transparent\">Inthe first place, scientific programs are written for a particularpurpose or problem. When it is written, authors figure out that itmight be useful to other scientists as well. So the authors decide tomake ther program available. What is good about this kind of softwareis that it usually has been proven that it is good for something: youusually will find a reference reporting an experiment supported bythe software.</span></font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"background: transparent\">However,sometimes software is published while such results are still beinggenerated. Then, the program is a prototype and you might betest-driving it, which is not bad in itself, but you need to beprepared for surprises. Therefore, l</span></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-style: normal\"><span style=\"background: transparent\">ookout for hard data what the program has been used for. If a realresearch question has been answered, this is much harder evidencethan a proof-of-concept or a statistical evaluation of an algorithm.</span></span></font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-style: normal\">Themost successful programs are the ones used over </span></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">along period of time. They are generally the most stable. If you findevidence like </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><i><b>\"Overthe last two years, the program X has been used by an average of Ypersons per month via our website.\"</b></i></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">,y</span></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">ou know you are on safeground.</font></p><h4>2) Are the authors responsive?</h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Field-testinga program is good and necessary. Scientific programmers cannot expectthe same number of users as your average mobile app. Often enough,they have to do with a few dozen users, and sometimes it is just youand them. The good news is that they have time for your questions.Give the documentation a chance first, but as soon as you get stuck,</font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>write to the authors</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">!If they care about their program, you should get a response within acouple of days. Usually, this provides both of you with usefulinformation.</font></p><h4>3) Where is the program available?</h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Ofcourse, a program needs to be somewhere physically, so that you candownload/install/execute it on your computer (unless you use it via aweb interface). There is however more to it than putting a zip fileon a web page. You can look out for instance, whether the authorshave deposited their program in a public code </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>repository</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">like </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>Sourceforge, Github</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">,or </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>Bitbucket</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">.These havens for open-source software make it easier for someone elseto join working on a project - actually, you can browse all thesource code on the web pages. When you see them, it is a sign notonly of collaborative spirit, but also the program is in a more neat,cleaned-up form than if it were just a collection of files. And youcan be sure that it will still be there tomorrow.</font></p><h4>4) How can the program be installed?</h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Onestep further, you can check whether there is an auto-installationprocedure: Good signs are if the program is installable via any of</font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>PyPi, CPAN, CRAN, Maven</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">or as an </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>Ubuntu package</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">.Also, if there is a separate </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>Windowsinstaller</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">, a mobile app orsimilar thing that installs the program with a few clicks, it is asign that the programmers made an effort for you: these things take alot of time to build. All these tools are indicators of solidengineering practices, so if you see them it tells you the authorshave thought about the sustainability of their software. </font></p><h4>5) Can you prove the program works?</h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Whenyou use a program, you need to be 100% sure that it does exactly whatyou think it does. You may very well be unforgiving in this point,especially when calculations are involved that you cannot simplydouble-check on a pocket calculator (which is probably why you wantto use a computer in the first place). The authors are actuallyresponsible of proving that their program does what is written in themanual. Because software changes within days or weeks, simplyreferring to the results section of a publication is not enough!</font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Howcan you verify then that a program works? </font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Eachscientific program should include at least one set of </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>sampledata</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">. There should be aninstruction how to use the sample data and exactly what </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>output</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">it produces. Sometimes, this approach is broken down into smallsteps: a </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>cookbook</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">explaining small actions and their effect. Eventually, you will findan </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><b>automatic test suite</b></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">.This is a script that automatically checks whether different parts ofthe program work correctly. When you see a message like</font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Courier New, monospace\">110of 110 tests OK</font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">youknow that at least everything the developers felt important to checkworks.</font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Allof these methods have in common that some input data with a knownoutput is used. They allow you to verify whether the program worksnow and on your computer, as opposed to </font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><i>'Along time ago, far far away...'</i></font></p><h4>Conclusions</h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Ifa program fails several of the above quality indicators, it does notmean that the program is bad or that the authors can't program.Probably you are seeing only a tiny bit of all the work that wentinto the software. But it means that your risk as a user is higher,because you need good faith if you use a prototype, and lots of trustwhen using a program</font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Thelist in this post is incomplete.
