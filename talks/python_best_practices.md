# Best Practices for Debugging, Testing and Maintenance

Experienced programmers know that good programming involves a lot more than
writing code. Python offers an established set of techniques from several areas:
Debugging is not an extraordinary activity, but certain tools and
procedures are available. E.g. automated tests ensure that bugs donâ€™t
come back. Finally, maintenance practices keep programs healthy for a long period of time. As a program grows, these best practices become more and more important.

The inexperienced programmer is often unaware of the tools available to
make Python programs more stable. This talk provides an overview of
accepted best practices for debugging, testing, and maintenance, and
provides hints what kind of project they are applicable to.

The talk draws a map of tools and practices, including:

* pdb
* PEP8
* py.test
* pyscaffold
* virtualenv
* Sphinx
