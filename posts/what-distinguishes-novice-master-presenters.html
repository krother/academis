<p>When I was listening to Mark Hunter, the 2009 World Champion in Public Speaking, I was moved. Hisprized speech <i><a href=\"http://www.markhunter.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">“A Sink Full of Green Tomatoes”</a></i> brought me to a point where handkerchiefs wereneeded. Two days later I had the opportunity to hear the same speech by Mark a second time. Ithought to myself: <i>“Now I know the story, so I won’t cry this time.”</i> I was wrong.</p><p>Becoming a world-class speaker certainly is a long way. Even getting halfway there is a long way(and probably sufficient for most of us). But what is it that distinguishes novice presenters frommasters? After observing lots of speeches on TED, Google TechTalks, and attending workshopsgiven by a whole series of public speaking champions, I identified six areas that help you to locate yourself on thepresenters’ learning path.</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" src=\"/static/uploaded/presenters.png\"></div><h3>1. Timing</h3><p>Finishing on time is key to all presentations. While inexperienced presenters might use a watch orclock to check his pace, professionals rehearse their presentations many times. They spend hours tofine-tune their text, when preparing for contests even to the second. As a result, they become socomfortable with their material that they can improvise freely while keeping the clock in check.</p><h3>2. Contact with the audience</h3><p>Many first-time presenters believe that presenting is one-way communication. When you feel morecomfortable on the stage you might ask a question or two – rhetorical or real ones, both result in areaction. More reactions a speaker can elicit include eye contact, emotions, laughter, language,physical activities, and – hopefully – thinking. There is a lot of communication happening bothways, and it can be turned into a form of art.</p><h3>3. Notes</h3><p>Using notes is a good thing. It is disturbing to forget your text and not having it anywhere. Or thefear of forgetting may be worse than a small ‘thinking pause’ itself. Notes at least give provide youwith a backup plan. Practically, loose sheets of paper easily get messed up when you are nervous. Aclipboard helps with that. Alternatively, PowerPoint can display notes for your eyes only parallel toslides. With more confidence, you may use cards with key sentences or words instead. Occasionally,you can see even experienced moderators on TV use cue cards. Do professional speakers use notes?Most of the time, they don’t.</p><h3>4. Slides</h3><p>Covering a presentation from beginning to end with slides is common in scientific presentations.Opinions on the subject differ a lot, and there is <a href=\"http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/10-20-30-rule-guy-kawasaki-powerpoint/\" target=\"_blank\">controversy</a>. On one hand, using a deck of slidescertainly gives a beginner a firm structure that helps him to say what he wanted to say. On the otherhand, it is easy to create a bad PowerPoint presentation. Many excellent speakers limit their visualinformation to a minimal number of pictures or diagrams, and switch to a black screen in between.If the message allows, you also see them using flipcharts, whiteboards, props (items), or their barehands.</p><h3>5. The stage</h3><p>When I came on a stage for the first time, I looked at a big, scary, empty area. I was looking for asafe spot, and the lectern was such a place. A lectern protects the speaker from the audience – and isexcellent for hiding notes, handkerchiefs, extra batteries for your light saber (laser pointer), magicrings and whatever you carry in your pockets. The only bad thing is that a lectern hides you as well.Movement and gestures are strong tools to support a presentation. Professional speakers frequentlyleave that safe haven and expose themselves in exchange for full contact with the audience. It doesnot mean that they are jumping fervently about the stage. But they are aware that movementconveys a meaning, and strive for a consistent meaning of body, voice and words.</p><h3>6. Experience</h3><p>Each speaker is different. The only way to find your best presentation style is to figure out whatworks well for you. What you see when you watch master presenters is only the result of a longprocess, and many, many hours spent in front of an audience. One thing is for sure: talent is only asmall portion of it. In other words: <a href=\"http://www.mannerofspeaking.org\" target=\"_blank\"><i>“All the great speakers were bad speakers at first”</i> (Ralph W.Emerson)</a>. If you want to be good at running, you need to run a lot. If you want to be good atprogramming, you need to write a lot of programs. If you want to be good at speaking, you need togive a lot of presentations.</p><p>There are lots of opportunities where you can practise: <a href=\"http://www.scienceslam.de\" target=\"_blank\">Science Slams</a>,<a href=\"http://www.pecha-kucha.org\" target=\"_blank\">Pecha Kucha nights</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.toastmasters.org\" target=\"_blank\">Toastmasters speaking clubs</a> have astage waiting for you.</p>
