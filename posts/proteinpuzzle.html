If the audience in a tutorial session has this thought, it is time to try something different. For instance, switch from slides to a haptic medium. Solving a puzzle, students can interact, reflect and reinforce what they heard in the presentation, and possibly develop questions for a follow-up discussion.</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/uploaded/transcription1.jpg\" style=\"padding:20px;\"></div><h4>How it was done</h4><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p>The exercise on <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">transcriptional regulation</span> (see Figures) was done as part of a one hour tutorial session in the <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/index.php\">Theoretical Biophysics Group</a> at the HU Berlin. After a warm-up exercise and 20-25 minutes of presentation on the subject, groups of participants got a set of 17 labeled paper proteins, a big sheet of paper, and a thick pen along with a task description:</p><p style=\"font-style: italic; text-align: justify;\">Assemble the parts of the transcription machinery given on the paper cards.<br>Draw the DNA that undergoes transcription including the strand direction,core promoter, TATA element, and upstream activator sequence.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"></span>The participants assembled the transcriptional machinery for about 20 minutes, followed by a summary and an open discussion.</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/uploaded/transcription2.jpg\" style=\"padding:20px;\"></div><h4>How to get it right</h4><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are planning to create a puzzle with molecules (or any other complex system), there are a few points worth considering:</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Leave degrees of freedom.</span> It is good if there is more than one correct solution. This gives all your listeners a fair chance to get it right. In the above example, the exact position of each component was not crucial, just the arrangement of the main groups.<br></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Require domain-specific knowledge.</span> If your puzzle can be solved by a 5-year-old, the science part got lost. To fit the parts together, the key should be in the main message of your presentation (or previous knowledge). <br></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The components may give clues.</span> Shape and color could convey helpful information, for instance grouping elements together, or one piece serving as a template on which others are assembled (like the red polymerase in the figuer).&nbsp;</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Highlight key features in a summary.</span> Explain what is important in your system in the summary. Point out what your participants did well - and skip small mistakes generously.<br></li></ul></div>If you feel your puzzle is rather a little bit too easy, then you probably got it right. Your audience does not need to solve a tough chestnut. Simply digesting the subject with their own hands supports them to gain an overview over a complex topic, and remember.<br></div>
