<h1>10 Quesions to ResearchGate</h1>

<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">with Ijad Madisch</span><br></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In early 2012, I came across <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGate</a>, a website that has been praised as <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"Facebook for scientists"</span>. The site helped me to sum up my impact points quickly, so I got curious, and decided to ask the creators what else their site is good for. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad Madisch</span>, answered all of my questions promptly. Here is the full interview:<br></p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">How would you describe ResearchGate in one sentence?</span></h5><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad:</span> <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGate</a> is the world’s largest professional network for scientists and researchers.</p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">Social networking sites are popping up like mushrooms. Why another one?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>ResearchGate offers useful tools created specifically for scientists - it combines social networking with data sharing, various collaborative applications and an easily searchable, comprehensive publications database. In addition, academic institutions and scientific societies are able to create private workgroups in which they can engage directly with their members. This variety makes ResearchGate a unique application, meeting the diverse needs of researchers and scientists.</p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">What is the main benefit for scientists?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>ResearchGate makes it possible to stay current with your field and research interests while connecting you with like-minded researchers. Members can be searched by skill which makes it easy to find experts in specialist fields. You can exchange ideas and collaborate with others, no matter where in the world they are. Projects are no longer confined to one laboratory, one campus or one researcher’s network. </p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">I have published a paper. How can ResearchGate help me?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>Uploading a full-text version of your publication is a simple and straightforward process, while your personal publication index provides a quick way to present your findings to other researchers. Additionally, ResearchGate hosts a self-archiving repository. Here, our publication index is automatically matched with publishers’ copyright agreements so authors can see which full-text versions of their articles they can legally upload and make available to researchers worldwide. The ReserachGate profile is designed to aid resource management; after saving papers to their personal libraries, users can export entries in XML to various reference management programs (such as EndNote). When users upload their papers, ResearchGate will use semantic matching to not only suggest related publications, but also to recommend similar discussions and researchers. You will always hold the rights to your publication. As soon as you delete a file it will be removed from our platform and databases.</p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">Uploading papers seems to be an important feature of ResearchGate. Are you planning to build a huge repository of full text papers?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>One of our main aims is to provide our users with the latest full-text papers and research findings. Our self-archiving repository is unique in that it gives members access to publications whether published or not. In 2011 alone ResearchGate gained 800,000 new self-archived full-texts.&nbsp; Furthermore our extensive literature search scours our internal resources as well as eight major external research databases (including PubMED, arXiv, IEEE, CiteSeer, Cornel University library, NASA, RePEc, BioMED Central), and 1000’s of smaller Open Access repositories through OAI to find relevant publications. </p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">If I want to announce a conference, what should I do to get the announcement into ResearchGate?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>If you have an account on ResearchGate, you can easily announce conferences on our network. Just go to <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.researchgate.net/conferences">http://www.researchgate.net/conferences</a> and click on “create a conference”. From there you can upload essential information regarding your conference i.e. name, date, venue, a short description and a link to the conference website. You can also add detailed session information including speakers and abstracts and stay in touch with conference delegates before, during and after the event using our discussion threads. &nbsp;</p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">If I have a job to offer, what should I do to get the announcement into ResearchGate?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>To advertise your job on ResearchGate simply go to <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.researchgate.net/jobs">www.researchgate.net/jobs</a> and click on „post job for free“. From here you can create your personal employer account and a public employer profile. The job will be checked and approved by our team within 24 hours. In addition the job will be included in a monthly job-newsletter that is tailored to our users based on their science disciplines. </p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">How can I limit the amount of updates about publications/conferences/jobs I receive?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>In your profile settings you can decide if and how you want to receive updates about recent network activity, publications, conferences or jobs. Just go to your profile and click on “edit profile”. Under “notifications” you can customize all settings.</p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">What is your business model?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>ResearchGate is completely free of charge to our users and always will be. The network was initially set up using seed funding from friends and family. In September 2010 we closed our Series A venture capital funding round. At the moment our main aim is to concentrate on developing tools and features that will benefit the ResearchGate community and science as a whole. </p><h5>Kristian: <span style="font-style: italic;">What are your plans for the near future?</span></h5><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ijad: </span>ResearchGate’s unique features connect scientists and researchers from all over the world, making it easier for them to collaborate and share information. In the coming months we’ll be developing more innovative tools that will continue in this vein. We base our updates exclusively on user feedback; our members inspire our ideas and how the network and its applications are developed. </p>
