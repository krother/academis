On top of that it is expected that you take care of <i>"softer"</i> duties like communicating with other scientists, getting funding and planning your career. When you are new to science, this sums up to a big pile of work. With more experience it is still a big pile of work. But eventually you will figure out how to get things done more efficiently and have fun doing it.</p></div></div><p align="justify">Realizing this, <b>Phil Bourne</b> initiated the <i><b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22Ten+Simple+Rules%22+PLoS">"Ten Simple Rules"</a></b></i> series to help new scientists getting started.<!-- BUTTON !--><!-- SUMMARY !--> Numerous authors have contributed to more than 15 two-page articles published in PLoS Computational Biology. I think the articles give undergraduate and PhD students a realistic understanding of how science works. My ten favourite articles from the <i><b>"Ten Simple Rules"</b></i><b></b> series are:</p><table class="table"><tbody><tr><th>Ten Simple Rules for ..</th><th>Comment</th></tr><tr><td><b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030213">Doing Your Best Research</a></b></td><td>advice on developing realistic ambitions. </td></tr><tr><td><b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030229">Graduate Students</a></b></td><td>a brief survival guide for PhD students.</td></tr><tr><td><b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0020121">Selecting a Postdoc Position</a></b></td><td>decision helpers on the if, where and how after you obtain your PhD.</td></tr><tr><td><b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002108">Building a Scientific Reputation</a></b></td><td>quality is everything.

For instance, you don't learn how to write a paper from reading two pages. But they help you to avoid the biggest mistakes. In my opinion the Ten Simple Rules articles are ideal for starting a discussion on the subject. For instance, as an undergraduate you could present one of the articles during a journal club and ask more experienced scientists to share their experience. Just keep Rule #2 for presenting in mind: <b>Less is More</b>. Ten rules at a time are enough. After all, you have experiments to do as well.</p><p align="justify">The ZIP file contains PDFs, a list of references and PMIDs for these ten articles.</p><p><b><a href="files/Ten_Simple_Rules.zip">Download as ZIP</a></b></p>
