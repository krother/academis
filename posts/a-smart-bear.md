# A Smart Bear

*My favorite blog on entrepreneurship*

Once, there was a smart bear, who founded a company. After a few years his enterprise took off and he lived comfortably ever after. Having lots of time, he started to write a **blog**, so that all the bears in the forest could read how they could overcome difficulties in their own businesses.So.. if you are going for a pot of honey, don't be a stupid bear.
