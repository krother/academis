# Scientists are Entrepreneurs

**by Magdalena Rother, Kristian Rother and Tomasz Puton**

Entrepreneurship is about creating a business under conditions of uncertainty. In science it is the same, only you create knowledge instead of money. We believe entrepreneurial thinking may help scientists to move forward in their field or to start a business on their own. There is vast literature, which is why we compiled our favorite starting points here.
