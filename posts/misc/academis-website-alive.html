<h1>The Academis Website is alive</h1>

<p>It took less than a month to create a functional website for Academis from virtually nothing. I think the team did a terrific job, since the Python code and HTML/CSS were created from scratch. </p><h4>What did I learn?</h4>

<ul><li>Feedback from your team can help you a lot to conceptualize what you are trying to build.<br></li><li>Don't tell your designer which colors to use unless yours are really good. It makes their work difficult.</li><li>It's a lot of fun to adjust jQuery elements on <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">ThemeRoller</a>.</li><li>Not everything about a website needs to be decided right away. You might feel comfortable leaving some <span style="font-style: italic;">'white space'</span> your concept.<br></li></ul><br>Sure, if you want to create a similar site but without the shopping basket and fancy navigation, <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is a quicker and cheaper option. Many webspace providers such as <a target="" title="" href="http://www.hosteurope.de/">HostEurope</a> offer a button that installs WP, and you can apply standard templates with a few clicks, not knowing HTML or anything.<br><br>On the other hand, if you want to build a sophisticated data structure or business process, you may find a more customizable architecture like <a target="_blank" title="" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> more useful.<br>
