<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few days ago, I had my debut in Berlin on the first annual meeting of the <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.netzwerk-wissenschaftsmanagement.de/\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Netzwerk Wissenschaftsmanagement</span></a>. I was there to make some contacts. The conference not only featured speakers and participants from all corners of the scientific landscape. Also, the organizers made an effort to <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">diversify the programme</span>, inluding<br></div><ul><li>Panel discussions.</li><li>Special interest group sessions.</li><li>Five-minute lightning talks.<br></li><li>A bulleting board to gather suggestions.</li></ul>I wish more conferences would be like this one!<h4>Challenges in Science Management</h4><p></p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I learned during the conference is that you cannot put a MBA into a research institution and expect everything to work better. After all, most researchers are an idealistic, freedom-loving group of people, as one speaker acknowledged when talking about <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">staff development</span>: <br></div><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"We scientists are not staff and we do not want to be developed. We are special.\"</span><br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, todays' universities need to be competitive, professional, efficient, and transparent. The job of a science manager is thus to create business processes that have the support of all people involved. To communicate decisions in a complex organisation, and to differentiate among particular institutions. And on top of it, we can expect the future to be even more complex. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Being a science manager promises to be an exciting job.</span></div><p></p><h4>Conference Quotes</h4>I picked up some beautiful sentences about managing science, which I translated and paraphrase here:<br><ul><li>A university is like a garden. It takes time to grow.</li><li>Before all, make sure you get the right people.</li><li>Do not let the university become a company.</li><li>The president of a university is more like a mayor than a CEO.</li><li>Keep your house in order, whether it is a lab, an institute, or a faculty.</li><li>As a science manager, you need to have one leg in science, and good friends in the administration.</li><li style=\"font-weight: bold;\">You have to love science.</li></ul><p>To which I have nothing to add.</p>
