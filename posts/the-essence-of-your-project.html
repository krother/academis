<h4>How would you describe your research project in less than a minute?</h4><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Expressing the essence of your project in 60 seconds is called an <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">elevator pitch</span> (also called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sales pitch</span> or simply <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pitch</span>).A pitch is not only a starting point for creating a longer piece of text, or starting a conversation with a stranger e.g. during a poster session, it also helps to focus your attention on the most important aspects.</p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"></div><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, you know what your project is about. Making the decision what to say if you have only 60 seconds can be difficult though, because lots of things may appear important at first. Extracting the central aspect is hard work. How to create a good pitch then?</p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"></div><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I recorded <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"/static/pitch1.mp3\">my first pitch</a> on my mobile while walking the baby. When listening to it, I found clumsy expressions and excess words I didn't like. So I recorded a second one. This turned out to be a fun exercise, so I recorded ten pitches with slight variations. I deleted half of them right away, then discussed the rest at home and got a series of critical, constructive comments.</p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"></div><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most improvements aimed at:</p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"></div><ul style=\"text-align: justify;\"><li>Using more postive expressions.</li><li>Removing buzzwords and non-natural language.</li><li>Making the text pleasant to listen to.</li></ul><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"></div><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next day I repeated the exercise. Finally, I wrote down my text and recorded <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"/static/pitch10.mp3\">a mature version</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">note on Dec 2nd: my pitch has been evolving continuously ever since. Now, its quite different again).</span><br></p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"></div><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Summarizing, to create a good pitch:</p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><nl></nl></div><ol style=\"text-align: justify;\"><li>Create a raw version.<nl></nl></li><li>Have it reviewed by a critical person.</li><li>Repeat 1.-2. until you don't find anything to improve.</li></ol><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><nl></nl></div><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can create a presentation from a pitch. You can write a paper from a pitch. You can even build a company from a pitch. The more crystal clear your central idea is, the better it will permeate the work - and you can bet that your audience will acknowledge that.</p>
