<p><b>A concept map is a structured visualization of a topic showing no more than seven concepts.</b></p><p>Humans gather most information through sight. Therefore, a visual presentation of a subject facilitates understanding. A key point in lesson preparation is to prepare a visual overview of the subject. In this guide such visualizations will be referred to as <b>concept maps</b>. Concept maps can be depicted as mind maps, diagrams, flowcharts, or use a visual metaphor:</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" src=\"/static/uploaded/concept_map_carbohydrates.png\" width=\"500\"></div><p><i>Concept map for a short lesson on carbohydrates.</i></p><p>A good concept map limits itself to the most important aspects of a field. There should be no more than 5-7 points in one map. If you need more details, you can zoom into one particular aspect and explain it on a separate diagram. Alternatively you can annotate the initial map further as soon as your students have digested the initial map.</p><p>A concept map serves many purposes: introducing a subject, showing an overview, repeating, displaying what a certain part of a tutorial focuses on etc. A well-crafted concept map serves as the backbone of your teaching unit.</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" src=\"/static/uploaded/concept_map_star.png\" width=\"400\"></div><p><i>Concept map for kicking off a training for academic teachers.</i></p>
