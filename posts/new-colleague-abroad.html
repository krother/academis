<h1>From Abroad to Aboard: How to help a new Colleague?</h1>

<p><strong>A new colleague or coworker is going to start in your lab soon.</strong> He or she is from a different country, maybe even a different continent. The city you live in and are familiar with will be a very strange place for him or her, and acclimatization can be demanding at the beginning. You would like to help a little, but certainly, you don't want to end up <strong>babysitting</strong> if it turns out the person is a poor slot or is not playing <a target="" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat">Tit for tat</a>. </p><p>Is there anything you can do? </p>

<p>You can help by making the situation less complex for your new colleague. Show him a clear route through the first weeks. You can try this <a target="" title="" href="files/NewColleagueChecklist.pdf">Checklist [PDF]</a> <a target="" title="" href="files/NewColleagueChecklist.docx">[DOCX]</a>, or create your own. </p>

<h3>Print two copies of the list</h3>
<p>One copy is for you, one for your colleague. Talk about once a week, find out what he's been doing. Check off things that are working well. Make it clear to your colleague that you are expecting him to take care of things by himself, or find help where it is required. Do not start doing stuff for him. The idea of the checklist is that a little control will be probably appreciated, because there are too many new things anyway.</p>

<h3>Is that really necessary?</h3>
<p>I agree, many people adapt easily and make friends faster than you write an email. In that case the checklist would be exxagerating. But usually, you don't know the person that well before. He might be used to bureaucracy working differently. He might get stuck on the language barrier somewhere. Or he dives straight into a research project and forgets everything else. </p>

<p>At some point, even a genius will get homesick. Typically this happens after 5-7 months spent abroad. Then it is good to have a little life already. You can consider the checklist as a safety mechanism. The message you are sending with it is <strong><i>"Good to have you here. We want you to feel comfortable. Now lets roll up our sleeves and get something done."</i></strong></p>
