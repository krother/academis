<h1>How to structure a Presentation?</h1>

<p>Many scientists assume that the default structure of a scientific presentation should be:</p><ol><li><p>Introduction</p></li><li><p>Methods</p></li><li><p>Results</p></li><li><p>Discussion</p></li></ol><p>You even find detailed instructions on how many slides each section should have. This four-part structure has the advantage that it is easy for the presenter to implement. However, I think it neglects three key areas contributing to a successful presentation:</p><ul><li><p><b>Intelligibility</b><br>A presentation is not a paper. The structure above is useful for a paper because it helps you to find the according parts of an experiment quickly. However, you cannot jump back and forth in a live presentation. If you missed out a detail when the speaker described his method ten minutes earlier, you are lost.</li><li><p><b>Purpose</b><br>The purpose of a manuscript is usually to report an experiment. With a presentation this is not necessarily the case. It could be as well to persuade the audience of a theory or simply get yourself a job. The structure of the presentation needs to contribute to your goal.</li><li><p><b>Variety</b><br>When you have to listen to 10+ talks all following the same structure, you might get bored more easily. Of course it depends on the topic, but I guess I am not the only person suffering from <i>conference narcolepsy.</i></li></ul><h3>Alternative structures</h3><div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/speech_structure.png" width="400"></div><p>A more flexible structure consists of an <b>opening</b>, a <b>body</b> with 3-5 main points, and a <b>closing</b>. The main purpose of the opening is to gain the attention of your audience. The body can be implemented in several ways:</p><dl><dt>Enumeration</dt><dd>1. First example; 2. Second example; 3. Third example</dd></dl><dl><dt>Timeline</dt><dd>1. Past; 2. Present; 3. Future</dd></dl><dl><dt>Comparison</dt><dd>1. First hypothesis; 2. Second hypothesis; 3. Second hypothesis is better</dd></dl><dl><dt>Dramatic Structure</dt><dd>1. Problem; 2. Struggle; 3. Climax</dd></dl><p>When closing a presentation you can refer to your opening. This helps you to reinforce your main message. For instance, in this article I wanted to emphasize that there is more than one possible structure for a scientific talk. I hope it helps you to make a conscious choice which structure to use yourself.</p>
