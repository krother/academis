# Data Analysis in Python

## Outcome

After this course you will be able to process, summarize and visualize tabular data efficiently using the `pandas` library.

## Target Audience

Analysts, researchers and engineers who would like to handle larger data sets more efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of Python

## Course Description

The `pandas` Python library is a practical everyday tool for the analysis of tabular data. 
This course improves your skillset for working with datasets ranging from a few dozen to a several million entries in Python. The course uses hands-on examples to cover exploratory data analysis, extracting relevant summaries and creating attractive diagrams. 
The integration of `pandas` with interactive environments like IPython und Jupyter will allow you to support answers to many questions with data quickly.
