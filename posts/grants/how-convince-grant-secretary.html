Read the grantdescription very carefully, and stick to it by the letter. Forinstance, <i>\"700 words maximum\"</i> means that 705 are too many,<i>\"Deadline May 15th\"</i> means May 16th is too late already.</font></p><!-- SUMMARY !--><p>Counting pages is less work than finding reviewers, so if yoursecretary has dozens of applications to process, he will first rejectall that do not fit the criteria.
