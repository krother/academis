<h1>Defended! Two Fresh PhD's report</h1>

<div class="media"><img class="media-object pull-left" alt="" src="images/Team3.jpg" width="400"></div><p align="justify">Last Friday, two of my long-term colleagues defended their doctoral theses at the <b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.bioleng.amu.edu.pl/page.php">Adam Mickiewicz University Poznan</a></b>. I had the pleasure to talk to <b>dr. Joanna Kasprzak (Asia)</b> and <b>dr. Tomasz Puton (Tomek)</b> right afterwards. Here is what they said:</p>

<div align="justify"><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> Congratulations! How do you feel?</i></h5><p><b>Asia:</b> I can't say yet. I'm totally overwhelmed. I still need to digest everything.</p><p><b>Tomek:</b> I'm tired but happy. I'm surprised that it was much easier than I thought, especially after the trial presentation.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> What was the most exciting moment during your PhD period?</i></h5><p><b>Asia: </b>probably the day when my program (<b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.genesilico.pl/pyry3d/">PyRy3D)</a></b> was awarded as a finalist of the Killer Application Award in 2011 during the ISMB/ECCB conference in Vienna.</p><p><b>Tomek: </b>The moment when I noticed that there are people in the scientific community really interested in what I do (<a target="_blank" title="" href="http://iimcb.genesilico.pl/comparna/"><b>CompaRNA</b></a>). This is when I started to be really motivated.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> What was the most difficult part?</i></h5><p><b>Asia: </b>When I couldn't attend the conference in Vienna and present my work and received congratulations from the commitee.</p><p><b>Tomek: </b>Multiple resubmissions of the same manuscript to different journals. That slowed down everything a lot.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> What would you recommend other PhD students?</i></h5><p><b>Asia: </b>Interact with other PhD students, visit other labs, attend meetings/conferences/workshops and exchange opinions and experience. Be brave in asking questions and getting answers to your problems. Stay focused on your goals.</p><p><b>Tomek: </b>Keep on going! But you need time to relax. Don't go to the lab on weekends. Find a hobby not related to your PhD.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> What would you recommend supervisors?</i></h5><p><b>Asia: </b>Employ PhD candidates who are passionate with their work, but also will add some non-scientific value to the group. Good atmosphere in the lab can produce much better results than competition within.</p><p><b>Tomek: </b>Keep calm. Forget about ASAP.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> Asia, you got two children while doing your PhD. What practical things should one consider when planning to have a family?</i></h5><p><b>Asia: </b>Planning is the most important. You have to organize your time very carefully and divide it into reasonable parts like: work, home and rest. In my opinion you also need to be prepared for flexible working hours and have someone who will help you to make this machinery work.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> Could you name three things that helped you balance your work and family life?</i></h5><p><b>Asia: </b>It is not so easy. you have to prioritize your life very carefully. it is obvious that whenever my children need me, I am there even if I have to stay late and work at night in return. Probably one also has to realize that when you work and have very small children you have to organize your time more carefully and sometimes leave your ambitions behind. Being perfect at work and at home is impossible. Be as good as possible and concentrate on the final goal, and you will achieve it.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> Tomek, you, Asia and three of your colleagues are co-founders of <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.vitainsilica.pl/en/"><b>Vitainsilica</b></a>, a bioinformatics startup. What does Vitainsilica do?</i></h5><p><b>Tomek: <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.vitainsilica.pl/en/">VitaInSilica</a></b> provides bioinformtics support for researchers and scientists. We develop bioinformtics software tailored to individual needs and provide wide support in analyzing biological data using computational tools.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> What did you learn as an entrepreneur that you did not at the university?</i></h5><p><b>Asia: </b>That a product is the most important thing for customers and it is even better to show preliminary "working pieces" and ongoing progress than just visions and ways how it should work and how to improve it (<a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.scrum.org"><b>Scrum</b></a>...). We scientists spend a lot of time on thinking, planning, discussing things. It is very dangerous when this part of the project, even though it is very important, will take you too much time and in the meantime requirements change.</p><p><b>Tomek: </b>A perfect solution of a given problem is the one that makes your customer very satisfied and happy, Not the one which is perfect in terms of the methodology used.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> Tomek, you have been working as a trainer for Vitainsilica and elsewhere. What pluses and minuses do you see in this occupation?</i></h5><p><b>Tomek: </b>Plusses: It's perfect for someone who likes travelling (I like). You constantly meet people from different backgrounds what inspires and motivates you to develop new skills. Minuses: I don't see any.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> If you were to start over, would you do anything differently?</i></h5><p><b>Asia: </b>Yes, probably I wouldn't take so many side projects and duties at work and concentrate on my PhD and related projects only.</p><p><b>Tomek: </b>Yes, i would probably do some things differently. But I do not spend time thinking about how my life would look like if I had the chance to do things differently.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> What are you going to do next?</i></h5><p><b>Asia:</b> I have just received a new grant for the next two years. At the moment I am also preparing a grant application for my own group and in several weeks I will probably start a postdoc position in Poznan. </p><p><b>Tomek: </b>Focus on <b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.vitainsilica.pl/en/">VitaInSilica</a></b> and keep on developing my company.</p><h5><i><b>Kristian:</b> Thank you a lot for the interview!</i></h5></div>
