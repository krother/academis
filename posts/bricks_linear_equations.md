# Solving a linear optimization problem with PuLP

## Problem Description
 
We want to place a series of colored bricks in a N x M box

![Bricks](images/bricks.png)

The bricks need to be placed according the following rules:

* all bricks with the same colour should end up in the same column
* if this is not possible, the rightmost column of one colour should be filled up first
* bricks of one colour should be as close to each other on the x-axis as possible

A possible solution could look like this:

This article shows how to solve this problem using the **linear equation solver PuLP**. The code example below is also available as a [Jupyter Notebook](files/BricksLinear.ipynb).

## Preparations

First, we define the bricks and their colours in Python:

    :::python
    bricks = ['a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'b1', 'b2', 
              'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4', 
              'd1', 'd2', 'e1']

We also define the size of the box to stack bricks in. A list of positions will help us later.

    :::python
    XSIZE = 4
    YSIZE = 3
    positions = [(x,y) for x in range(XSIZE) for y in range(YSIZE)]

## Modeling a Linear Equation System

To model our problem using **PuLP**, we need to perform four steps:

1. Define the model variables
2. Define the optimization function
3. Add linear constraints
4. Run the solver


### Step 1: Define the model variables

Our model variable will be a binary matrix with four dimensions. The first two dimensions are quite obvious: each space in the box has its own **x, y** position in the matrix. The third dimension are the bricks **b** themselves. We use them to specify, which brick occupies a certain space. 

The fourth dimension is probably the least obvious: It is the column **rb** in which bricks of one colour should be placed. We use it to link bricks of the same colour together.

    :::python
    from pulp import *

    v = LpVariable.dicts("bricks", (range(XSIZE), range(YSIZE), bricks, 
        range(XSIZE)), lowBound = 0, upBound = 1, cat = LpInteger)

#### Why don't we simply assign each brick a number instead of an extra dimension?

Yes, it would be nice to cut out an extra dimension from the matrix. However, we cannot discretisize numbers in a linear equation system (e.g. say *"If x is 3 do this, if x is 4 do something else"*). I find this quite a strong limitation, and the binary matrix is the proper way to say *"I have discrete bricks a, b, c.. in my system".*.

#### I don't understand why range(XSIZE) appears twice.

Each brick has two X values assigned: the first is the column **x** in which the brick actually is, the second is the rightmost column **rb** in which bricks of this colour should gather. We need this second value to implement the second and third rule above.

### Step 2: Define the Optimization Function

We first tell PuLP that we have something to minimize.

    :::python
    m = LpProblem("Bricks", LpMinimize)

We want to tell PuLP to minimize the distance bricks have from their colleagues to the right. For that, we need to construct a penalty matrix first. We say that any block in column *x* that ought to be in colum *rb* has a penalty of `10` for each column in between:

    :::python
    penalties = {}
    for x in range(XSIZE):
        for rb in range(XSIZE):
            penalties[(x, rb)] = 10 * abs(rb - x)


In a linear equation system, everything needs to be composed of terms like `a*x` that are added together. This is why you will see **sum** symbols frequently. Our minimization function *m* is:

    $$m(v) = \sum_{x,y,b,rb}penalties_{x,rb} * v_{x,y,n,rb}$$ 

In PuLP, this minimization function is formulated as a sum with a scary-looking list comprehension:

    :::python
    m += lpSum([penalties[(x,rb)] * v[x][y][b][rb] \
        for x,y in positions for b in bricks for rb in range(XSIZE)])


### Step 3: Adding linear constraints
 
Now we specify additional rules and conditions. We need to formulate these in the linear form as well. More sums, that is.

#### Condition 1: One brick per position
First, we want to specify that there can be only one brick per position. In math notation this is:

![formula for one brick per position](images/brick_equation.png)

This condition must be true for each possible **x** and **y** value.

In Python, it looks similar if you are familiar with **list comprehensions**.

    :::python
    for x, y in positions:
        m += lpSum([v[x][y][b][rb] for b in bricks \
            for rb in range(XSIZE)]) <= 1


#### Condition 2: One position per brick
Likewise, each brick can have only one position. This should be obvious, but given the binary matrix we still have to say it explicitly:

    :::python
    for b in bricks:
        m += lpSum([v[x][y][b][rb] for x, y in positions \
            for rb in range(XSIZE)]) == 1


#### Condition 3: no bricks right of the rb column
We want to implement the column **rb** (our fourth dimension) as a hard boundary. So no bricks should appear right of it. Hopefully this results in bricks stackin up in the **rb** column, and those left over left of it.

We do this by adding a constraint that certain columns need to be zero.

    :::python
    for x in range(XSIZE):
        for rb in range(XSIZE):
            if x > rb:
                m += lpSum([v[x][y][b][rb] for y in range(YSIZE) \
                    for b in bricks]) == 0


The art of formulating a linear problem with PuLP is to know, when to put a for loop into the sum (corresponding to an index in a sum symbol) or outside (corresponding to having multiple sums).

#### Condition 4: bricks of same colour stick together
This was the tough one while developing the example. We tell our equation system that any two bricks of the same colour must have the same right boundary **rb**. This way, we enforce that the same penalties in the minimization apply to one colour.

For the implementation, we need to add a separate constraint for each pair of bricks. For each pair and rb value, the corresponding values in **v** are either both 1 or both 0, which we can check by calculating their difference:

    :::python
    pairs = [('a1', 'a2'), ('a1', 'a3'), ('a2', 'a3'), 
         ('b1', 'b2'),
         ('c1', 'c2'), ('c1', 'c3'), ('c2', 'c3'), 
         ('c1', 'c4'), ('c2', 'c4'), ('c3', 'c4'),
         ('d1', 'd2')
        ]

    for b1, b2 in pairs:
        for rb in range(XSIZE):
            m += lpSum([v[x][y][b1][rb] for x,y in positions] \
                 + [-v[x][y][b2][rb] for x,y in positions]) == 0


### Step 4: Run the Solver
Finally we can ask PuLP to solve the problem:

    :::python
    m.solve()
    print("Status:", LpStatus[m.status])


## Display the result
Lets see whether it really worked:

    :::python
    for y in range(YSIZE):
        row = ""
        for x in range(XSIZE):
            for b in bricks:
                for rb in range(XSIZE):
                    val = value(v[x][y][b][rb])
                    if val == 1:
                        row += '{}[{}]'.format(b, rb)
            row += '\t'
        print(row)


Which is one of the possible solutions.

## Concluding Remarks

* The benefit of this approach is that PuLP takes care of the solving entirely. A similar approach was tested with about 40000 constraints in total, and PuLP came up with a solution within seconds.
* If you were to implement this procedure as an algorithm, it would be **much easier** to express the model. But in a linear system we have no other option, otherwise the model won't be linear. 
* The number of constraints explodes if you have more bricks or a bigger box. The complexity is something like $O(b^2 * x)$, which certainly is bad news.
