<h1>What distinguishes Novice from Master Presenters?</h1>

<p>When I was listening to Mark Hunter, the 2009 World Champion in Public Speaking, I was moved. His prized speech <i><a href="http://www.markhunter.com.au" target="_blank">“A Sink Full of Green Tomatoes”</a></i> brought me to a point where handkerchiefs were needed. Two days later I had the opportunity to hear the same speech by Mark a second time. I thought to myself: <i>“Now I know the story, so I won’t cry this time.”</i> I was wrong.</p>

<p>Becoming a world-class speaker certainly is a long way. Even getting halfway there is a long way (and probably sufficient for most of us). But what is it that distinguishes novice presenters from masters? After observing lots of speeches on TED, Google TechTalks, and attending workshops given by a whole series of public speaking champions, I identified six areas that help you to locate yourself on the presenters’ learning path.</p>

<div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/presenters.png"></div><h3>1. Timing</h3><p>Finishing on time is key to all presentations. While inexperienced presenters might use a watch or clock to check their pace, professionals rehearse their presentations many times. They spend hours to fine-tune their text, when preparing for contests even to the second. As a result, they become so comfortable with their material that they can improvise freely while keeping the clock in check.</p><h3>2. Contact with the audience</h3><p>Many first-time presenters believe that presenting is one-way communication. When you feel more comfortable on the stage you might ask a question or two – rhetorical or real ones, both result in a reaction. More reactions a speaker can elicit include eye contact, emotions, laughter, language, physical activities, and – hopefully – thinking. There is a lot of communication happening both ways, and it can be turned into a form of art.</p>

<h3>3. Notes</h3><p>Using notes is a good thing. It is disturbing to forget your text and not having it anywhere. Or the fear of forgetting may be worse than a small ‘thinking pause’ itself. Notes at least give provide you with a backup plan. Practically, loose sheets of paper easily get messed up when you are nervous. A clipboard helps with that. Alternatively, PowerPoint can display notes for your eyes only parallel to slides. With more confidence, you may use cards with key sentences or words instead. Occasionally, you can see even experienced moderators on TV use cue cards. Do professional speakers use notes? Most of the time, they don’t.</p>

<h3>4. Slides</h3><p>Covering a presentation from beginning to end with slides is common in scientific presentations. Opinions on the subject differ a lot, and there is <a href="http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/10-20-30-rule-guy-kawasaki-powerpoint/" target="_blank">controversy</a>. On one hand, using a deck of slides certainly gives a beginner a firm structure that helps him to say what he wanted to say. On the other hand, it is easy to create a bad PowerPoint presentation. Many excellent speakers limit their visual information to a minimal number of pictures or diagrams, and switch to a black screen in between.If the message allows, you also see them using flipcharts, whiteboards, props (items), or their bare hands.</p>

<h3>5. The stage</h3>
<p>When I came on a stage for the first time, I looked at a big, scary, empty area. I was looking for a safe spot, and the lectern was such a place. A lectern protects the speaker from the audience – and is excellent for hiding notes, handkerchiefs, extra batteries for your light saber (laser pointer), magic rings and whatever you carry in your pockets. The only bad thing is that a lectern hides you as well. Movement and gestures are strong tools to support a presentation. Professional speakers frequently leave that safe haven and expose themselves in exchange for full contact with the audience. It does not mean that they are jumping fervently about the stage. But they are aware that movement conveys a meaning, and strive for a consistent meaning of body, voice and words.</p>

<h3>6. Experience</h3>
<p>Each speaker is different. The only way to find your best presentation style is to figure out what works well for you. What you see when you watch master presenters is only the result of a long process, and many, many hours spent in front of an audience. One thing is for sure: talent is only a small portion of it. To borrow a quote by Ralph W.Emerson from <a href="http://www.mannerofspeaking.org" target="_blank">John Zimmers Blog</a>: <i>“All the great speakers were bad speakers at first”</i>. If you want to be good at running, you need to run a lot. If you want to be good at programming, you need to write a lot of programs. If you want to be good at speaking, you need to give a lot of presentations.</p><p>There are lots of opportunities where you can practise: <a href="http://www.scienceslam.de" target="_blank">Science Slams</a>,<a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org" target="_blank">Pecha Kucha nights</a>, and <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org" target="_blank">Toastmasters speaking clubs</a> have a stage waiting for you.</p>
