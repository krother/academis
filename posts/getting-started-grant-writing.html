Like publishing and presenting, it is one of the key skills to make your science recognized and keep it going. But where to start when you consider writing an application? Write an abstract? Draft a budget? Call the agency? <br></p><p align=\"justify\">After working through a pile of literature on grant writing, in particular&nbsp;<b> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.hfsp.org/funding/art-grantsmanship\">“The Art of Grantsmanship”</a></b> by Jakob Kraicer, I have identified three main points to consider when you are gearing up for a grant application.</p><!-- SUMMARY !--><h4 align=\"justify\">1. Start early</h4><p align=\"justify\">Grant writing takes time. It is not so much the writing itself that is most time-consuming. Figuring out what exactly you are going to do is a thought process that needs several rounds of evaluation by yourself and by people that help you. Also, grants involve paperwork like permissions and reference letters. Allocating enough time for them is crucial, because a missing document e.g. due to a professor being abroad can mean the end to your application. As a rule of thumb, you can consider starting a year in advance good timing.</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/uploaded/grant_timeline.png\"></div><h4 align=\"justify\">2. Talk to your host</h4><p align=\"justify\">Talking to your future host laboratory is necessary to answer a number of essential questions: Is the place really interesting for you? Can you imagine living there? Who will support your application? Is the chemistry between you and your future PI working? Can you visit the place for some time in advance? Can you not only establish a scientific contact, but create evidence of your cooperation? Preliminary data <i>\"We already did the experiment xyz together\"</i> will provide strong support for your application.</p><h4 align=\"justify\">3. Find the right call</h4><p align=\"justify\">The available grant calls differ a lot, and details often matter. You need to investigate some funding bodies. Your task is to find a call to which you are not only formally eligible, but also where your application fits to the mission of the funding body. This is why it is not a good idea to copy-paste an application and send it to several funding bodies simultaneously. To get a feeling what ideas have a chance of funding, browse the list of already funded projects. The best thing you can do is to get your hands on the text of a successful application. Ask around! In April 2013, I have compiled a<b> <a href=\"mailto:krother@academis.eu?subject=Please send me a copy of 'Funding Opportunities'&amp;body=Dear Kristian, I would like to obtain your summary of 20 funding sources. Please send it to:\">summary of 20 funding bodies</a></b> relevant in central Europe. </p><p align=\"justify\">Starting early, talking to your host, and figuring out where to apply gives you a good foundation for writing a powerful application. </p>
