# Sun Tzu for Pacifists

*What a peaceful leader can learn from ancient war strategy*

The Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote a book on military strategy 2500 years ago. Today, the book is part of standard literature for managers and leaders worldwide. What leadership techniques have made *"The Art of War"* timeless reading even for a pacifist? *"The Art of War"* teaches that leadership is a craft that requires considering forces invisible at first. The real adversary is often not an armed force, but plans, morale and deception. If *"the highest excellence is to conquer without battle"*, what can we do to conquer the immaterial?

The goal of this workshop is to learn about Sun Tzus philosophy, leadership principles and tools for making clear decisions. I would like to inspire you to read and learn more about leadership.

*Knowing yourself and knowing your adversary, you will not be conquered in a thousand battles.*
