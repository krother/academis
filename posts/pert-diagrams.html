<p><b>PERT diagrams</b> are a tool to display the logical organization of your project. You have probably seen a PERT diagram somewhere already. Now they also have a name.</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" src=\"/static/uploaded/pert.png\"></div><h4>How to create them?</h4><p>Draw a diagram consisting of boxes, circles or other shapes. Each element represents a milestones or work package in your project. Connect the boxes to indicate how the parts of your project depend on each other. Good annotation by numbers and labels is key.</p><p>There exists a more restricted formal definition of PERT charts, but in the context of scientific projects it is seldom found.</p><h4>What are they good for?</h4><p>PERT diagrams are useful to give an overview of a long-term project, in particular in grant applications. The overview is based on the assumption that you can design the project in a top-down manner. Once you are entrenched deep in a project, they are less useful for day-to-day planning. However, looking at the PERT may help you to find the overall direction again.
