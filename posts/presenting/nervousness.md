# Dealing with Nervousness

Six Strategies against Nervousness

1. Memorize beginning + end
rehearsing
* the end is the end
2. Go to sleep
* sleep well
3. no caffeine
Water
* no coffee (increases your tension) or coke (makes your voice chords sticky) - just water before important presentations
4. move 
6. breathe
breathe to own the stage
* take you time to 'own' the stage. breathe. look for the friendly face. wait 10-15 sec.
* cue cards / iPad / clipboard (5 words/page)


physical exercise
* some light physical exercise right before (aeroplane exercises or outside/bathroom, not on the stage!)

7. Find the happy face
* being nervous is good




# What matters to CEOs/other power persons

* monetary gain/loss
* position of company/strategy
* intra-company politics
* short, to the point
* reasonable technical detail
* build trust
* no bullshit

## Presenting to an unknown audience

* no abbreviations!
* give definitions 
* explain basic terms
* get in touch with the audience, e.g. by poll questions *"Who in the audience is programming Python? Please raise your hand."*
* reinforce the structure of your presentation by giving short introductory/summarizing statements to each section. *"In the second part, I will explain random forests." and "Taken together, random forests allow you to quickly 'classify fuzzy input".* This helps non-expert listeners to stay on board.


## Presenting to a HR audience

* weave in your transferable skills at some point
* show somehow what is your personal connection to the project - this is what makes you unique and memorable
* offer a printed CV - slides are gone too fast
* offer a small but tangible next step in conversation. "I am curious what the typical presentation in your company is about - let's get in touch." instead of "If you would like to book a presentation course, please email me".
* dress up a bit (in Germany we have some room at the top, particularly in IT. Assuming your job involves other things than sitting in front of a screen, being presentable is part of the game.
* make up your mind what your leadership skills are. The reason behind is that there is a general shortage on leadership characters and any potential employer will be evaluated under this aspect. If you have a PhD it is even more imperative, because you are destined to lead others in some way.


Where to present your mini-CV
After asking a more experienced colleague, we came to the conclusion that we strongly advise against putting your CV into the presentation. It distracts and does not add value. 
Better prepare your CV as a handout.

 Credentials and direct advertisement
One of the most common ways to ruin the start of your presentation is a second slide introduced with "a little bit about myself.." It's very boring. If you run a company and do an advertisement, it's the same. Either you managed to build a reputation before you enter the stage (usually, this is the MC's job) or you provide value on the stage. Pulling out your CV does neither. However, if you have an interesting story to tell that is (even remotely) related to your topic, you have something your audience can relate to. 
Example: "My career in data analysis started like this: One day, my PhD supervisor told me how he smuggled the entire protein structure database across the iron curtain into East Berlin - they had just transferred a few dozen files from punch cards to floppy disks. From that day I knew there are worse things than HTTP GET".
(indirect message: I have a PhD, and have done data analysis for a really long time).
