# Create ad-hoc artwork with Wordle

#### Good artwork is expensive
.. or time-consuming to make. However, if you are staring at an empty first slide or the naked webpage of an event you are organizing, wouldn't it be great to pull a catchy image out of your hat?

In that case, you can try a **Wordle**. On the website [www.wordle.net](http://www.wordle.net) you paste a text, Wordle analyzes word frequencies and creates a word cloud with more frequent words being bigger. Common words are removed automatically, so you won't see a huge *the* by default. You can paste your abstract, the presentation titles of your event, or even your full PhD thesis.

Thus, a Wordle comes in handy when you want to have a little artwork quickly. In the resulting image, visitors can see at the first glimpse what the topic is about. While proper images or proper words are hard to find, an image with the proper words is not.
