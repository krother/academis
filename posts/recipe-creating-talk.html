<p><b>by Magdalena Rother, Ulrike Münzner and Kristian Rother</b></p><p><i>Designing a presentation without an audience is like writing a love letter starting with <br>\"to whomever it may concern\"<br> (John Zimmer)</i></p><p>Thirty minutes and your presentation will be over. You will get applause, leave the stage and that’s it. So is it worth to put a lot of effort into preparation? Have you ever thought that if you have 20 people watching a lousy presentation that lasts half an hour, it won’t be 30 minutes wasted, but a total of 600 minutes - 10 hours. On the other hand a talk performed well is an adventure both for the audience and the speaker. It can make people laugh or make them cry. It can make people remember you, make friends, contacts, and project opportunities. But how can you prepare a great presentation?For many people, preparation starts the moment they create a new PowerPoint document. But for excellent talks, preparation starts much earlier.</p><p>In this text you will find a nine step recipe for preparing a scientific presentation in a top-down fashion:</p><h3>The recipe</h3><ol><li><p><b>Why are you going to present?</b><br>What do you want to achieve? Set a clear goal – also called a purpose statement (e.g. you want to inform the audience about something, you want to persuade them to take a particular action, you want to entertain, you want to get an excellent grade, etc.).</p></li><li><p><b>Understand the circumstances of your talk.</b><br>Where and when are you going to speak? How much time do you have? What technical requirements you need to meet (e.g. get a projector or speak with a microphone). Do you need to use a template for your slides? Is your presentation going to be evaluated, and by what criteria?</p></li><li><p><b>Familiarize with the subject.</b><br>Before moving on, you need to know roughly what you will talk about. If you present an article, you need to read it. Is there other homework to be done? Be aware how much time you have to prepare. You don’t need to dig very deep at first. You can read more later.</p></li><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/static/uploaded/audience.png\" class=\"media-object\"></div><li><p><b>Why should your audience care?</b><br>Consider who is going to sit in the audience. How many people will be there? What is their background? How much do they already know on the subject? What views/opinions might be predominant? What do they want to hear? The more honest and clear you are about the value to your audience, the bigger the impact. </p></li><li><p><b>Summarize your presentation in one sentence.</b><br>What is the one simple message of your talk? Summarize the contents in five to ten words, and write it down. Does your summary match the purpose statement and does it contain value for the audience? You can build the entire presentation on that summary.</p></li><li><p><b>Collect material.</b><br>Now is a good moment to do more homework: Read more, note essential facts, collect data, numbers, references, images, and diagrams. You can pile up material at first without establishing a timeline or even deciding what to use. Just make sure what you have and what you don’t.</p></li><li><p><b>Set a structure.</b><br>Every talk needs an opening, a main part and a closing. Divide the main part into 3-5 main points. Summarize each point in one sentence. Again, check whether each of your main points contributes to the purpose statement and main message.</p></li><li><p><b>Create slides.</b><br>Now your presentation is almost done. The second last thing is to prepare slides. As a scaffolding, create slides with a single sentence each. Review your presentation and make sure they connect well to each other. Each slide should lead to the next. Even if you have great material, if it does not fit the overall goal of the presentation, remove it. A coherent story is better than beautiful slides. Only then, add content to the slides. </p></li><li><p><b>Rehearse and check time.</b><br>Rehearse your talk at least once. The main risk is that you need more or less time than you estimate. On one hand, staying in the given time frame means showing respect to both your audience and organizers. On the other hand, knowing how much time you will need means there is one thing less you need to worry about. </p></li></ol><p>Summarizing, each of these nine steps either increases the value of your talk directly, or gives you more freedom while you talk. Together, they contribute to memorable presentations.</p>
