# Why Less is More

**Clear structure is key to make your presentations easy to understand.** But how to start creating a solid structure? One possibility is to brainstorm ideas and then select a few. This is the idea behind the **'3 out of 6'** technique. The basic approach is simple: You write down six ideas for the main sections of your talk, and then remove the three worst or least interesting ones.

Now, you may think: *"What? In my presentation ALL points are equally important."*

Probably you are right. But even then, you will find differences: Which point is the one best supported by hard evidence? Which point is the most relevant to your audience? Which do you feel you can tell in a fun and engaging manner? Taken together, what do you think will happen to your presentation, if you instead of presenting six good points present three extraordinary ones?

To tell about everything you know about a subject means avoiding the question which is the best content. Cramming all available findings into a talk only because they are in your head would mean you are ignoring the needs of your audience. But your listeners need clarity above all, and 1-2-3 is more clear than 1-2-3-4-5-6. You can leave something away or group to points to illustrate a bigger context. Last but not least, when you don't tell everything right away, your audience may want to hear you speak again.

*(OK, if this is not what you would like to do, you should copy your manuscript to Powerpoint slides in Times New Roman 8pt, ignore the figures, read the text, and you will be safe from presenting for the rest of your life.)*

The first time I saw the 3 out of 6 method it was used by [Florian Mueck](http://www.thesevenminutestar.com/). It is general enough to be applicable whenever you need to fit content into a given time frame: presentations, lectures, but also when preparing interactive workshops and courses.

It may hurt a little at first to discard some of your content. Nevertheless this technique can help you to create space in your presentation, so that instead of rushing through a deck of slides you can be calm and relaxed during your next talk.
