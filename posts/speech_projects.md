# Free Speech Projects

Together with a team of contributors, I am building a book full of speech projects, published them under a Creative Commons License. 
The project descriptions are available in **English** and **German**.

The material can be found at **[github.com/krother/speech_projects](https://github.com/krother/speech_projects).**


## What are speech projects good for?

Now, what can you do with these *speech projects*? There are three main objectives:

1. Becoming better at public speaking
2. Becoming better at meeting facilitation
3. Having fun

To use the material in practice, you need a group of like-minded people (a speaking course, speaking club, friends or colleagues). You prepare for a project, present it in front of a group and ask for encouraging suggestions.

Because **constructive criticism** is not an easy thing to do, better ask someone experienced in evaluating speeches for guidance. Apart from professional speaking coaches, there are plenty of speaking clubs (in organizations like Toastmasters, Agora and many others).

## What projects are there?

The projects include:

* Easy speeches for people with little speaking experience
* Basics of public speaking
* Speeches for Data Scientists
* Roles for facilitating meetings
* Diverse evaluation roles
* Raising multi-cultural awareness

We are striving to extend the range of projects and constantly improve quality of the material. **If you think you have something to contribute as well, get in touch!**
