### Benefits

The *activity log* or *time log* is a tool that helps you to:

* become aware how you use your time
* collect hard evidence on how you use time
* identify your high-performance hours
* identify time wasters
* start improving your time management

### How to do it

* create an empty table
* note every half hour what you have been doing
* repeat the process for 1-2 weeks
* evaluate the result (e.g. categorizing)

If you want to track your time in a very detailed manner, you can try the tool **RescueTime** ([www.rescuetime.com/](https://www.rescuetime.com/)).

There are plenty of other tools (forms, programs, mobile apps etc.) that support keeping a time log. But in principle an empty sheet of paper does the job.
