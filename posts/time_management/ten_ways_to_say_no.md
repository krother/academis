# 10 Ways to say No

![saying no](images/say_no.png)

Saying no to other people is one of the most difficult things that keeps us from managing our time effectively. The trick is to know your options ranging from a half-yes to an outright no. Here are ten examples:

### 1. Promise to do it later

*"I can't do it right now, but I will deal with it tomorrow morning."*

### 2. Expect something in return

*"Of course, but I will need someone to look at my evaluation."*

### 3. Refer to someone elses expertise

*"I can't review the manuscript, but I can name you 3 people who can."*

### 4. Ask to come back later

*"I need to get this done today and I don't know how long it takes. Could you ask me again this afternoon?"*

### 5. Delay the response

*"It's hard for me to tell right now, but I will let you know tomorrow."*

### 6. Be unavailable

Close your door, switch off you phone and email - many less important requests will never reach you.

### 7. Offer a small favor

*"I can't review the manuscript, but I can take care of your PCR this afternoon."*

### 8. Show gratitude for being asked

*"Thank you for considering me .."*

### 9. Give a hard reason why you decline

Giving a reason that has nothing to do with the other person.

*"I can't do it, because .."*

### 10. Say no

When everything else fails, you still have a blunt *"No* as an option.

*"No"*
