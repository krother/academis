### Why?
Estimate the time required for tasks (milestones, deliverables).

### How?
Share a set of tokens (playing cards, chips, etc.) to each person present. Assign a time value to tokens (1 week, 1 month etc). Go through the tasks one by one. For each task, everybody puts as many tokens into his hand as he thinks the task will take.  Reveal all estimates simultaneously. If there is discrepancy, it needs to be discussed why - maybe there are different views what the task is all about. 

It may be useful to have a special token meaning "I think this will take much longer.".

### Material:
Cards, chips or other tokens.

### Hints:
This makes most sense when 3-5 people are present.
