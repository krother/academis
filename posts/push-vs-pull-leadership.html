A push system fosters discipline. The main driving force for people in a push system is pressure (goals, expectations, deadlines).

The push approach helps you to achieve a goal when everything else is secondary.</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" src=\"/static/uploaded/push.png\"></div><h3>Pull systems</h3><p>You ask people what needs to be done. You review progress after some time. People do what they think is reasonable. A pull system fosters creativity. The main driving force in a pull system is intrinsic motivation (passion, ambition, purpose). In a pull system you typically find <b>facilitators</b> and lean management tools like <b>Kanban</b>. The pull approach helps you to develop people when everything else is secondary.</p><div class=\"media\"><img class=\"media-object\" src=\"/static/uploaded/pull.png\"></div><h3>Conclusion</h3><p><i><b>Wait a moment!</b> I need to grow great scientists <b>and</b> meet my deadlines! </i></p><p>It's a model.
