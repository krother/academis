<p align=\"justify\"><b>Andrew Dlugan</b> from Canada has been maintaining the <b><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://sixminutes.dlugan.com\">Six Minutes Blog</a></b> on presenting for several years . Of all presenting blogs i decided to describe Six Minutes, because I think it is conceptually close to the mindset of scientists - although politicians, news reporters and actors may find it useful as well. The blog covers a wealth of material: The <b>basic toolset of a successful speaker</b> is explained. Lots of articles give tips how to <b>create good PowerPoint slides</b>. Finally, there are in-depth analyses of <b>famous historical speeches</b> that you can enjoy. </p><p align=\"justify\">If you really have only six minutes to improve your next presentation, my three personal recommendations are:</p><div align=\"justify\"><ul><li><p>A wise discussion on Guy Kawasakis rule on <b><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/10-20-30-rule-guy-kawasaki-powerpoint/\">how many slides to use</a></b>.</p></li><li><p>A curriculum for beginners: <b>\"<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/12-days-ask-six-minutes/\">12 Days of Ask Six Minutes</a>\"</b>.</p></li><li><p>An impressive<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/public-speaking-blogs/\"> <b>list of 118 public speaking blogs</b></a>. Although <b><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://sixminutes.dlugan.com\">Six Minutes</a></b> appears first :-( and two of my pet peeves are missing, that is <i>a lot</i> of information.</p></li></ul></div><div align=\"justify\"><p>However, you probably won't need to read all of them. Your audience will thank you if you try one new technique at a time. Or at least every six minutes.</p></div>
