<h4>Technologies for web development</h4><p>One of the first things that I want Academis to have is a comfortable and informative website where I can put tips and tricks for scientists and of course write about tutorials I offer. After a few rounds of consulting with <strong>Justyna</strong>, we came up with five different tools that we want to use for developing the website.</p><ul><li><b>Web server:</b> We decided the website would be written in the <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.org\" target=\"_blank\">Django framework</a>. This is a toolkit for creating websites in the Python programming language. We picked it because we were both familiar with it.</li><li><b>Special effects:</b> We also decided to use <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery</a>, a JavaScript library for making sites easier to navigate.</li><li><b>Hosting:</b> Next we needed a place to host the website. We found <a href=\"http://djangoeurope.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DjangoEurope</a> to provide everything required at attractive conditions (cost of course, but also support by Django experts).</li><li><b>Version control:</b> To share the source code among developers and the server, we created a repository on <a href=\"http://bitbucket.org\">Bitbucket</a> that can be used with <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercurial</a>.</li><li><b>Project management:</b> And finally, to keep track of tasks in the project we use <a href=\"http://kanbanery.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kanbanery</a>.</li></ul><p>Of course, to each of these points there are many alternatives. But it was important to make a choice in order to move on.</p>
