<p>Reviewers are scientists working after hours. They usually do not get paid for their work. To convince a reviewer, you need to show that you appreciate their efforts and don't waste their time. Most reviewers are from a related field, so you can assume they speak the same language but do not know most of the components you are working on.</p><p>Generally, reviewers are convinced more easily by making their work easier. Reviewers typically have to comment on a number of criteria. Show them the value of your work by pointing out answers to these criteria in your application. For instance, if <b>Originality</b> is a criterion, it is a good idea to include a paragraph starting <i>\"This proposal is original because..\"</i>. Using bold face makes it even easier to find.<p>The criteria for reviewers include things like:</p><ul><li><b>Feasibility:</b> the methods are known, you have the equipment, preliminary data, papers.</li><li><b>Adequacy:</b> the right call and the right time.</li><li><b>Originality:</b> a new combination of skills, a problem you solve, a unique context.</li><li><b>Risks covered:</b> preliminary data, risk analysis or contingency plan, plan B.</li><li><b>Productivity:</b> Your CV, complementary collaborators, papers.</li><li><b>Competence:</b> Match of researcher and project. Why are you the best person to do the project?</li></ul><p>Most grant agencies publish the criteria for review online. Generally it helps reviewers if you provide the explicit answer first. Afterwards, provide the details to provide sufficient scientific depth. Your reviewers will be happy if they won't have to search in your application for the things they need. Having happy reviewers is a good step towards a successful application.</p>
