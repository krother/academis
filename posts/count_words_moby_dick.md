
# Coding Challenge: Count words in Moby Dick

### The Challenge

The book *"Moby Dick"* by Herman Melville describes an epic battle of a gloomy captain against his personal nemesis, the white whale. Who of them is mentioned in the book more often?

Write a program that counts how often each word occurs in the book. Determine how often the words `captain` and `whale` occur.

You can find the full text for Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick” as a text file on 
[www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org). 

The word `harpoon` occurs in the book 76 times.

When you know whether `whale` or `captain` occurs more often, you have mastered this challenge.

### What you can practise in this coding challenge

* Counting items
* String handling
* Regular expressions
* Sorting information


### Optional Goals

* Create a tabular output of all counted words and their respective frequencies
* Sort the words, starting with the most frequent ones
* Do not use variables

### Hints
