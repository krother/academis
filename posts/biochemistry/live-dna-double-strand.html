<h1>Live DNA Double Strand</h1>

<dl class="dl-horizontal"><dt>Summary</dt><dd>Your students build a double-stranded DNA, each base represented by one student.</dd></dl><dl class="dl-horizontal"><dt>Preparation time</dt><dd>30 minutes</dd></dl><dl class="dl-horizontal"><dt>Group size</dt><dd>20-50</dd></dl><dl class="dl-horizontal"><dt>What you need</dt><dd>A6 cards<br>lots of space</dd></dl><h3>How it is done</h3><div class="media"><img src="images/live_dna.png" class="media-object" width="500"></div><h4>Preparations and instruction</h4><p>Before the lesson, prepare four sets of cards cut into matching shapes and labeled A, G, C and T. Prepare one half of the cards in one colour, one half in another.</p><p>Instruct your students to hold a card in their left arm and use their right arm to grab another students' shoulder. Then give them the cards and ask them to assemble into two chains according to colour of the cards. They don't need any further information (in particular about the structure of DNA).</p><h4>Evaluation questions</h4><p>After some time, stop the exercise and evaluate. You can use questions like:</p><ul><li><p>How did you know where to position yourself?</p></li><li><p>What cards did match each other?</p></li><li><p>Were people in your chain facing in the same direction?</p></li><li><p>Were people in the other chain facing in the same direction as you?</p></li><li><p>What information did you need to find your position?</p></li></ul>

<h4>Knowledge gained</h4>
<p>The gain of knowledge should include:<ul><li><p>DNA contains complimentary pairs A-T and G-C.</p></li><li><p>The strands of DNA run in opposite directions.</p></li><li><p>DNA has the ability to self-assemble.</p></li></ul><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>I found this exercise very useful to energize the class at the beginning of a 90-minute lesson on the basics of DNA and replication. Especially as the lesson was in the afternoon, and the extra movement helped.</p>
