Give them some time to write down something and collect the papers in the box. Evaluate the answers. If you are collecting feedback, start readingthe answers <b>only after all students are out of sight</b>.</p><p>You can use this feedback techinique to collect ideas and suggestions from a passive group. For instance, when your lessons start very late, when students have a lot of respect, or when there is a language barrier. The method also helps if your group is heterogeneous or dominated by a few active trainees.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I often use this kind of poll for getting feedback after the first few days ofa course, and prepare the rest of the course to the answers. It is a foolproof method that you can apply spontaneously.</p>
