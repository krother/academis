# Creating Interactive Python Trainings

When training people to program in Python, you face a variety of situations: big and small groups, similar or mixed level of experience, different motivations or professional background etc. Therefore you will need more than one method to teach. In this talk, you will learn methods to create well-balanced, interactive teaching units.

The methods cover four phases of a training session:

1. Warming up: sparking interest for the topic and motivating the group
2. Introducing content: supplying facts in a non-boring way
3. Applying content: allowing participants to immerse deeply
4. Wrap-up: Summary, practical transfer and feedback

During the talk, Kristian will apply his favourite methods for training Python in face-to-face settings. Expect to participate very actively.
