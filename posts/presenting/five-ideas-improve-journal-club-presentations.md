# Five Ideas to improve Journal Club Presentations

![Five Ideas](images/five_ideas.png)

I hear very frequently that journal club presentations are perceived as difficult, boring or simply not as good as they could be. I have no ideal recipe to offer, but five things you could try without turning your lab upside down:

#### 1. Five words
Ask the presenter to summarize the presentation in five words.

#### 2. Record
Switch on a camera, phone or tablet. Share recordings with the presenter only.

#### 3. Checklist
Provide presenters with a [Checklist [PDF]](files/presentation_checklist.pdf) well in advance.

#### 4. Feedback
Share a small [feedback form [PDF]](files/feedback_sheet.pdf) on which spectators note one positive remark and one suggestion.

#### 5. Strict time control
Assign a volunteer to measure time and raise a signal 5' and 2' before the end.

The ideas above can be implemented without a lot of extra effort. There are probably many other things you can try. Keep changing until you find what works for you.
