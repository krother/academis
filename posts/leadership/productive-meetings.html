<h1>Productive Meetings</h1>

<p>Meetings are frequently quoted as the biggest time sink in professional life. Probably you have already been to meetings that drag on and finish without a tangible outcome. Would you prefer to attend a meeting perceived as a success, not a waste, by all people involved? During the monthly board meetings at my <a href="http://www.spreeredner.de" target="_blank">speaking club</a>, we are following a very strict procedure that has worked well for the past two years, involving two different presidents and 4-8 board members.</p><p>The bottom line is that successful meetings require preparation. Fortunately, the effort invested pays off immediately in the form of time-per-person saved or things achieved.</p><div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/meeting.png" alt="conference table with roles"></div><h3>The goal</h3><p>Why exactly are you having the meeting? For instance, <i>“To discuss *your topic*”</i> is not a goal, it is a process! Richard Templar defines <b>four purposes</b> meetings can have [1]: </p><ul><li>share information</li><li>collect information</li><li>make decisions, and </li><li>forge a team. </li></ul><p>Setting a clear purpose and goal involves talking to other participants in advance. This not only saves time but may occasionally make the entire meeting unnecessary. In brief, a good meeting is if you get it done, and get out.</p><h3>The chairman</h3><p>The role of the chairwoman or -man is to set a goal for the meeting, prepare the agenda, and run the meeting. During the meeting, the chairman opens and adjourns the meeting and makes sure the agenda is implemented. Depending on the chairman’s role in the team, the chairman can act as a facilitator focusing on running the meeting well, or as a leader that gives clear guidelines and influences decisions strongly. </p><p>To create a constructive atmosphere, you can ask all participants for a brief statement at the beginning. As a rule of thumb, let everybody speak once before anyone speaks twice.</p><h3>The agenda</h3><p>The agenda sets the start and end time and what is to happen in between. When writing an agenda, think about what you want to achieve with each point. What will be the outcome (a report, a decision, ideas etc.)? Often it makes sense to write the goals for each point into the agenda directly, so that everyone can see it. That way, agreement on the goal is more likely. Finally, each point on the agenda should have time allocated. Don’t be afraid to put a point of 3 minutes in your agenda if that is all the time it takes.</p><h3>The minutes</h3><p>The meeting minutes are the written result of a meeting. If decisions have been made or ideas have been collected, a single document is a good place to keep them. Not only do the minutes help to follow up and review the meeting later (e.g. actions decided), they also help to uncover misunderstanding among the attendants. </p><p>Keeping minutes requires a dedicated person other than the chairman. Minutes do not have to be long. It can be a single page listing: When did the meeting take place? Who was there? What ideas have been found? What decisions have been made?</p><h3>The timekeeper</h3><p>Time in meetings gets out of control far too easily. The timekeeper solves that problem by keeping an eye on the clock. If a delay occurs he can gently reminds the chairman or a speaker. If the problem persists, you can use a signalling device (we found flags or red/yellow/green lights and a mobile app working equally well). For reasons unknown, if you set the start of the meeting to an odd time (e.g. 10:05), people tend to be on time.</p><h3>Half-time break</h3><p>In a 90’-meeting a break of 10’ in the middle helps participants to maintain their focus. The interruption allows you to take breath and carry on to the end.</p><h3>No phones!</h3><p>Turn them off!</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>These tools help to facilitate meetings from 10 minutes to two hours. When you are planning a longer meeting, extra planning may be required to make the event cohesive and to avoid tiring out the attendants, e.g. using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gogamestorm.com/?p=263">7P framework</a>. For special situations like problem-solving sessions and conflicts more preparation is required as well.
