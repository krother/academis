## My 10 Favourite Talks from PyCon 2016

This month, I skipped *Star Trek* and *GoT* to watch a full dose of [PyCon 2016](https://us.pycon.org/2016/) talks. After watching several dozen talks, I picked 10 of them which I found relevant for the casual Python developer, or which were simply presented well. Here they are:

## 1. When is it good to be bad? Web scraping and data analysis of NHL penalties

**Wendy Grus**

### What is the talk about?
Wendy analyzes whether fouls in ice hockey pay off. To answer this question, she takes us through a typical data analysis pipeline: identifying a research question, harvesting data from the web, parsing it, dealing with data quality issues and finally building models.

### Why did I find it relevant?
I build very similar data pipelines at home , and I think many others do. Seeing one clear example from A to Z makes this a great talk for beginners.

### How does the speaker present?
To present data, you dont need fancy rhetoric skills.
Wendy comes up with a great structure and sticks to it. She picks one central theme and lets it drive the presentation. The outcome is tremendous clarity that gets the job done.

## 2. Better Testing With Less Code: Property Based Testing With Python

**Matt Bachmann**

### What is the talk about?
Matt introduces the [hypothesis](hypothesis.works) framework that lets you generate random tests with very little code.

### Why did I find it relevant?
I was missing a proper introduction into this kind of testing in Python for quite some time.

### How does the speaker present?
Two qualities of the talk stick out: First, the speaker shows great enthusiasm for his topic. Second, he does not claim to have all the answers but humbly invites everybody to join as learners. That is what kept me on board.

## 3. To mock, or not to mock, that is the question

**Ana Balica**

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYG5C1CEkOk)

### What is the talk about?
What mocking in automated testing is, how to use it, when to use it and when not.

### Why did I find it relevant?
It is hard to find a good introduction into the topic.

### How does the speaker present?
Ana chose Shakespeare as a central theme that provides strong structural support for the entire talks.

## 4. What Is and What Can Be: An Exploration from `type` to Metaclasses

**Dustin Ingram**

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI0JUY2qd2A)

### What is the talk about?
An *"initiation"* to types and metaclasses in Python.

### Why did I find it relevant?
There were seveal talks on PyCon touching on metaclasses and this is the one I liked best.

### How does the speaker present?
Dustin managed to reduce this complex topic to the bare essence and keeps it short. Quizzes included!

----

## 5. Python Typology

**Matthias Kramm**

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDm_YIQihhs)

### What is the talk about?
introduces static typing in python. Compares the static type checkers `mypy` and `pytype`. The talk demonstrates practical use cases, e.g. working with unannotated code.

### Why did I find it relevant?
Matthias provides an overview of static typing in Python *today*. Considering there is a lot of development happening in this area, this is a great resource to get into the topic. 

### How does the speaker present?
There is a nice surprise at the end of the talk!

## 6. Refactoring Python: Why and how to restructure your code

**Brett Slatkin**

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46PjvFki38)

### What is the talk about?
An introduction to *"Why and how to restructure your code"*. The talk takes a tour through refactoring strategies from extracting a variable to redefining class interfaces.

### Why did I find it relevant?
At the very beginning, Brett explains what refactoring is (*"repeatedly reorganizing and rewriting code until it's obvious to a new reader"*) and why refactoring is differenct in Python. The combination makes a great primer into the topic.

### How does the speaker present?
Brett presents extremely well-chosen code examples that are simple enough to present but complex enough to illustrate the problem.

## 7. What You Need to Know About Open Source Licenses 

**Felix Crux**

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_X9TK_VJak)

### What is the talk about?
A clear and useful overview on Open Source Licenses.

### Why did I find it relevant?
The talk gives very clear, actionable recommendations, and this is exactly what I need in this topic.

### How does the speaker present?
Felix sticks to the facts and simply gets the thing done.

----

## 8. From Developer to Manager

**Sean O'Connor**

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzBm0r8CxhY)

### What is the talk about?
Sean gives an overview of things that become relevant when you take over responsibility for a team. He gives ample reference where to find more information. 

### Why did I find it relevant?
I find there is a general shortage on leadership talks on conferences like PyCon. Many of Seans conclusions are absolutely not trivial like *"As a manager you are on the front line of mental health"*.

### How does the speaker present?
The first half of this talk improved from *"unbearable"* to *"great talk"* when I switched off the video (mainly because of the slides, not because of the speaker).

## 9. A tale of two cellphones: Python on Android and iOS

**Russell Keith-Magee**

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqdpK9KjGgQ)

### What is the talk about?
How to run Python programs on iOS and Android systems.

### Why did I find it relevant?
Russ pushes the frontier of what Python can do. He also emphasizes that Python needs to deal with both platforms if it doesn't want to fall behind. Once again, Russ takes leadership responsibility for the Python community.

### How does the speaker present?
I found this talk very intense, because it requires quite a bit of background knowledge. Russ addresses mostly advanced Python users. Others may find it difficult to grasp (I would have to watch it two more times if I were to **do** any of the things mentioned). The presentation itself is clear and works almost completely without visual aids (Russ uses slides but could leave away most of them).

## 10. Final keynote by K Lars Lohn

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSfe5M_zG2s)

### What is the talk about?
The meaning of nonlinearity for programming and our life.

### Why did I find it relevant?
It took me a while to figure out what the talk was about. The talk touches programming, fractal mathematics, education and diversity and finds common ground among all of them. The combination made me think and I found it inspirational.

### How does the speaker present?
**The talk is full of fireworks!!** Lars Lohn brings storytelling, motorcycling and live music alive. *Keynote* taken literally in a masterful way! 

**Have fun watching!**
