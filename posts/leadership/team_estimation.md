### Why?
Estimate the duration of tasks. People are bad at estimating time they need to complete tasks. We tend to be over-optimistic.

### How?
What helps is that we can compare the relative difficulty well.

1. Write goals/deliverables/tasks on cards.
2. Take the first card.
3. Take the next card and decide whether it is similar, less or more complex than the first.
4. Position the new card left, right or on top of the first depending on your decision.
5. When all cards have been sorted, number the piles by Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21). You now have a rough estimate of how the tasks relate to each other.

### Hint:
As soon as you complete the first tasks, you can calculate how much time you would need for the rest. This idea is used in Burndown Charts. Usually, the estimates are terrible at first, but with time and experience they become more accurate.
