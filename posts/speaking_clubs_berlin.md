*Scences from a rehearsal speech at a speaking club*

Recently, a couple of friends and I laid the groundworks for a new speaking club, the **Redesalon** in Berlin-Schöneberg. It is not the first of its kind. In fact, there are many clubs where people meet to rehearse and improve their speaking skills. As long as our **Redesalon** is not present online, here are a few other places to go:
