<h1>Strong Presentation Openings</h1>

<p><i>When I was on my very first conference, I noticed one thing common to many presentations: They all started with the words "First of all, I would like to thank the organizers..."</i></p>

<p>It took me 15 years to realize that this is not the best way to start a scientific talk. In fact, professional speakers like <a href="http://www.52speakingtips.com" target="_blank">Craig Valentine</a>  state there are plenty of alternatives to a standard thank-you opening phrase. There is more space for thanks after your opening.</p>

<p>The above opening wastes the most valuable moment of your presentation. The first 30 seconds not only set the climate for your speech, they also determine much of the reaction of your audience. The purpose of the opening is to catch attention in the first sentence. You can build interest, tension, sympathy or simply lighten the mood with a few words. </p><h3>How to build a strong opening?</h3><p>There are five openings recommended by professional speakers including <a href="www.bravenewsales.com" target="_blank">Jack Vincent</a> and <a href="www.florianmueck.com" target="_blank">Florian Mueck</a>:</p><div class="media"><img src="images/openings.png" class="media-object"></div><h4>A quote</h4><p>A quote gives your audience something to think right away. By referring to an authority, you suggest that you have considered other peoples' opinions (social proof). There are plenty of smart quotes to be found.</p><h4>A question</h4><p>Like the quote, a question makes your audience think. It allows for a smooth transition into your topic. Of all openings, this one is probably the easiest to construct.</p><h4>A single word</h4><p>A powerful word creates pictures and emotions: Consider what you see upon hearing Mahatma Gandhi. Do you see a bald man in a white dress with spectacles? Now, try the same with a word your scientific audience is familiar with. For instance, borrow from Star Trek: <i>"Yeast. The final frontier."</i></p><h4>A story</h4><p>Telling a brief story gives your audience something they can remember easily. Stories are an engaging packaging for all kinds of insight. Of course, the story needs to be connected to the contents of your talk. A good length for a story opening is between 30 seconds and two minutes.</p><h4>A polemic statement</h4><p>Teasing your audience is a strong way to bring their attention to 100%. For instance, the opening "Cells don't need RNA to make peptides." seems to question the central dogma of molecular biology (DNA:RNA:protein). However, toxins like *alpha-amanitin* are synthesized completely by enzymes. If this comes as a surprise for your audience, the polemic question worked. A polemic statement needs to be fine-tuned to the background knowledge of your audience.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>All five openings utilize the first 30 seconds of your talk well. How to move on after that? For instance, you could transition into a brief summary of your talk, describe an experiment right away, or acknowledge your team. A strong opening makes the difference between just having people in the audience and having attentive listeners.</p>
