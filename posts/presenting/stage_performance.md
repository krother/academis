# Stage Performance 

You don’t need to look perfect. Approachable is better.
Time
Stick to time!!!

## Voice
Pauses.     Give you authority.
Voice (loud, clear, good pace, breaks, intonation)
Coke destroys my voice. Water and bananas only before important presentations. No salty stuff. Chocolate if I’m really nervous.

## Body
Body language (comfortable open posture, supportive but natural gestures)
Eye contact
Clean, nice clothes
Remote to move freely is a must. If you have a lectern, leaving it is OK.
Coffee makes you shaky. Water
Are there alternatives to Powerpoint slides? (objects that you can show)

## Words

50/30/15 rule does not apply to scientific presentations.
Clear language (simple words, simple sentences)
Don't apologize (and never say something is less important or less interesting)
This is not so important.
This slide is not really necessary.
This is not so interesting.
This is very interesting.
This is very interesting, because!
Avoid words like: nice, really, important, interesting, very
Use 'significant' only when you can prove it statistically

## Where to get your text from
Read it from slides (worst)
Read it from a script. OK if you have rehearsed it. But bring a clipboard please.
Cue cards. Very smart. People on TV do it and it works. Write numbers on them!
Improvise and speak entirely freely. Are you sure you need this tutorial?
Rehearse your presentation well enough so that you can change spontaneously and still be on track. This is what masters do.
