Closing

The "Thank you" slide is not the worst, it at least lets the audience know clearly that the presentation is over. There are some other things you could place in the last minute:
Picking up a thread from the beginning of your talk (e.g. finishing a story). This alone turns presenting into a form of art.
The summary. Always nice to have.
Next steps (only makes sense if you really intend to continue the project)
A Call to Action (CTA), e.g. "I would be happy to talk to you about XX during the break"
The main purpose of the closing is a "soft landing" - not pouring in content to the last second helps your audience remember.

* Silent call to action ("You can learn more on our website")
* Quote
* Take up idea from the beginning
* Provocative or rhetoric question
* Acknowledgements don't have to be at the end.
* Finish on time
