# The Mechanics of Learning

*What Confucius, Montessori and Coding Katas have in common*

In this talk, I will present ubiquitous patterns in successful learning that help you to improve your own abilities, mentor junior developers and build key skills in a team. We will examine what *Confucius, Montessori and Coding Katas* have in common. You will explore a process for creating interesting learning challenges and critically assess whether the mechanics of learning apply to programming only, or to topics like software architecture or Scrum as well.
