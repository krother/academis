<p>A big project may seem intimidating at first. When you divide it into smaller portions, each portion becomes easier to manage. Instead of a single big goal, you have many small ones. The intermediate goals give you control Â– you know how much is already done. Also, each time you reach one goal, you have a success to be proud of.In a short project lasting a couple of weeks you can write down objectives as <b>SMART goals</b>. However, in a big project, for instance a grant proposal, more structure is required during planning. Commonly, the structure in a grant proposal consistss of <b>Milestones</b> and <b>Deliverables</b>.</p><h3>Milestones</h3><p>A Milestone is a time point at which the project has made important progress. A milestone is characterized by the time it should be completed, typically in project months. What exactly is to be completed is specified in the Deliverables. Thus, each Milestone needs to contain one or more Deliverables as evidence of success.</h3><h3>Deliverables</h3><p>A <b>Deliverable</b> is a measurable goal. To be measurable, a Deliverable must be either a physical object or computer file, approval by a person (e.g. a reviewer) or a declaration (you announce something is ready). Unlike Milestones, Deliverables do not necessarily have a time frame, although sometimes the time frame is given to display Deliverables in a GANTT chart.</p><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/static/uploaded/work_package.png\" class=\"media-object\"></div><h3>Summary</h3><p>In larger project proposals, Milestones and Deliverables are grouped further into <b>Work packages</b>. All three can be displayed in <b>GANTT</b> and <b>PERT</b> diagrams. Summarizing, both Milestones and Deliverables help to organize your project and get it done step by step. </p>
