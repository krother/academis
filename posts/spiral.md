# Coding Challenge: Spiral

### The Challenge

Write a program, that draws a spiral:

When your program draws a spiral with at least 3 loops, you have mastered this challenge.


### What you can practise in this coding challenge

* loops
* The **Pillow** library in Python
* The **turtle** module in Python

### Hints

* It is sufficient to draw the spiral as a series of short lines
* Where is it easier to start (inside or outside)?
* Both the Python modules `Pillow` and `turtle` are up to the task

### Getting started

If you have no idea where to start, try the following Python script:

    from turtle import forward, left
    forward(50)
    left(90)
    forward(50)

### Optional goals

* the line width grows thicker from the inside to the outside
* there is a color gradient along the spiral
