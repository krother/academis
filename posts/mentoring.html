<h1>Mentoring</h1>

<p><em>Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.</em><br>(John F. Kennedy)</p><h3>The mentoring cycle</h3><p>When you are supervising undergraduate or graduates students you have a strong role as a mentor. You are a source of information, of advice, and a role model. More generally, as a mentor you are someone supporting someone in a job, project or skill with your experience. Typically your support covers three areas:</p><ol class="arabic simple"><li>Identifying and setting goals</li><li>Getting things done</li><li>Giving feedback</li></ol><p>In a successful mentor-mentee relationship, you move through these stages repeatedly. The time scale for a cycle may vary from hours to years, depending on the actual goals.</p><div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/mentoring_cycle.png" alt="mentoring cycle: goals, action, feedback"></div><h3>Constructive Feedback</h3><p>Whatever your mentee is doing, he will need feedback to figure out what to improve and how. As a mentor, you are a valuable source of feedback. But good feedback also includes a form of criticism. It needs to be delivered in a constructive way so that your mentee will accept your suggestions. The <strong>Sandwich Technique</strong> is a tool to make feedback constructive.</p><p>To give constructive feedback, start with positive things - include concrete examples of what the mentee did well. Only after that give suggestions for improvement – simply telling the mentee what was bad is insufficient (most probably he already knows), he also needs to know how to do better. Finish with a positive, encouraging summary.</p><div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/sandwich.png" alt="sandwich feedback"></div><p>Don’t take the Sandwich too serious. When I was new to the Sandwich technique I had to talk to a PhD student about his project. I was eager to try the Sandwich and he knew it. When I stumbled through my remarks a little stiffly <em>“On the positive side..”</em> we both had to laugh. It was a good conversation.</p><h3>Meeting with Your Mentee</h3><p>When you meet with your mentee, you might follow this agenda:</p><ol class="arabic simple"><li>Ask your mentee what went well.</li><li>Give examples of what you liked.</li><li>Ask your mentee what could be improved.</li><li>Suggest improvements of your own or look for ideas together.</li></ol><p>When you are mentoring a person over a longer period, make sure to point out what progress he has achieved. Such support is the best feedback you can give.</p>
