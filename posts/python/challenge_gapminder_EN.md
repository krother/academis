# Programming Exercises for Data Analysis, Level A2

These exercises are for people who are learning a new programming language and would like to apply it to data analysis. They work with **Python**, **R**, but also when you getting familiar with libraries like **pandas**.

During the exercises, you will analyze from the **Gapminder Foundation** [www.gapminder.org](http://www.gapminder.org) on global demography.

In this challenge, you will learn:

* integrating data from multiple sources
* aggregation
* plotting, plotting, plotting

## Preparations

Download the Gapminder datasets from [www.gapminder.org](http://www.gapminder.org) on:

* fertility
* life expectancy
* population

## Exercise 1

Load all three tables and determine their dimensions.

## Exercise 2

Pick fertility and life expectancy for the year 2010. Integrate both in a single table.

## Exercise 3

Remove all rows with missing values.

## Exercise 4

Draw a scatterplot of fertility over life expectancy in 2010.

## Exercise 5

Draw a histogram of life expectancy in 2010. Try different bin sizes.

## Exercise 6

Make the histogram a publication-quality figure.

## Exercise 7

Draw a bar plot displaying the fertility of a few selected countries in 2010.

## Exercise 8

Repeat exercises 2-7 for the year 1960. Observe differences.

## Exercise 9

Make it convenient to repeat the process for any given year.

## Exercise 10

Calculate a correlation coefficient between fertility and life expectancy (for the year 2010).

## Exercise 11

Fit a linear model allowing to model fertility by life expectancy.

## Exercise 12

Read a list of country-continent pairs. Associate the continent with each country (e.g. as an extra column).

## Exercise 13

Summarize the world population by continent over time as a scatterplot.

## Exercise 14

Identify a few countries that are redundant in the dataset. Remove the respective entries.

## Exercise 15

Integrate all three tables into a single data structure.

## Exercise 16

Plot population, life expetancy and fertility from 1960 to 2010 in a single diagram.

## Exercise 17

Create a series of scatterplots like in Exercise 4 (one for each year) where the color indicates the continent.

## Exercise 18

Connect the scatterplots to an animation.
