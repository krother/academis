# Purposes of Presenting

#### Why are you presenting?

The obvious answers are

* *"To advertise my research."*
* *"Because I have to".*
* *"Because I like it"*

These answers are about yourself. But what about the other persons in your presentation? What other persons, you ask? Well, those on the other end of the laser pointer: Your audience. What about them?

Let's rephrase the initial question: **What do you want to achieve in your audience with your presentation?** Most of the time it will be one of four things:

### Inform
The easy one. Tell what you will say. Tell it. Tell what you just said. Get the message out, plain and simple.

### Persuade
There are many reasons to persuade: Convince people to adopt a theory. To give you money. A PhD. A job. To apply for a position in your laboratory. Whenever you are *"selling"* something, the purpose of the presentation is to persuade.

### Inspire
Motivate people to take a particular action, make them feel as a group, or simply build confidence. For instance, a talk *"How to finish your PhD"* certainly needs to inspire. Inspiring presentations are the ones given by scientific leaders.

### Entertain
Having a cartoon on slide two is one thing, but what is the point of giving a whole presentation to entertain in a technical field? Consider that drama is also entertaining. Think *"good story"* rather than *"ha-ha, funny"*. Also, I think there hasn't exactly been over-abundance of humour in science lately :-). The day you are asked to speak at 19:00 after a full day you will know why this category is not a joke.

The purpose of a presentation is usually one or two of the above. Deciding what you are aiming for helps to design everything else. It turns out there is a plenty of things you can achieve with a presentation. 

**Do it!**
