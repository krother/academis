How to build credibility as a Data Scientist?

There are four elements that build credibility (based on Aristotle)

Reputation
This one is a no-brainer: BScs, MScs, PhDs, certificates, published books, Oscars and Noble Prizes go in this category. Reputation is the reason Hillary Clinton makes 200k per speech. For you, having spent 3 months at DSR builds auto-reputation. Good for you!

2. Authority
Authority is mainly how self-confident you are on the stage. About half of it is the nonverbal stuff (takes lots of time to improve). The other half is enthusiasm (can't be faked).

3. Similarity
How similar are you perceived by your audience? You can find similarity in lots of things: dress code, family, habits, sports, things you do in life..  
Example: Let's say you want to present a weird hobby (playing the SpaceAlert board game) to data scientists. I would try the following: First, ask "Who of you has played a board game?" (hopefully everybody) Second, ask "OK, which is your favorite?" (collect 3-5 answers). Third I make us accomplices: "My favourite board game is SpaceAlert. In this talk I am going to tell you why and what it has in common with Agile Software Development".
Similarity is a life-saver if you have neither of the first two.

4. Empathy
How well you understand your audiences needs, and interact with them. Questions are powerful, the words "we" and "you" are essential. Again, empathy cannot be faked. (the example for 3. works here as well.)
