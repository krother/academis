 To provide popular names and maintain an acceptable performance level on our servers, we provide only the top 1000 names through our forms. However, we provide almost all names for researchers interested in naming trends.

To safeguard privacy, we restrict our list of names to those with at least 5 occurrences. We provide these data on both a national and state-specific basis, in two separate collections of files, each zipped into a single file. The format of the data in the two files is described in a "readme" file contained in the respective zip files.

In early 2005, Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the reason for the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She and Pitt were alleged to have started an affair during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). Jolie stated on several occasions that this was not true, but later said that they "fell in love" on the set.
